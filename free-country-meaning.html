                                            What is Globalization?We often hear the word globalization in many contexts and repeated frequently as a concept to denote more trade, foreign companies, and even the ongoing economic crisis. Before we launch into a full-fledged review of the term and its various manifestations, we should consider what we mean when we say globalization.Globalization is the free movement of goods, services, and people across the world in a seamless and integrated manner. Globalization can be the result of the opening up of the global economy and the concomitant increase in trade between nations. In other words, when countries that were hitherto closed to trade and foreign investment open up their economies and go global, the result is increasing interconnectedness and integration of the world economies.Globalization can also mean that countries liberalize their import protocols and welcome foreign investment into sectors that are the mainstays of its economy. Globalization means that countries attract global capital by opening up their economies to multinational corporations. Globalization also means that countries liberalize their visa rules and procedures to permit the free flow of people from country to country. Globalization frees up the unproductive sectors to investment and the productive sectors to export-related activities resulting in a win-win situation for world economies.Source: https://www.managementstudyguide.com/what-is-globalization.htmAnswer the following questions:1.

                                            The music for liturgy and devotional music of the lowlands of Luzon reflects the impact of Spanish colonization which lasted for almost three centuries, and how the Christianity affected the religious practices of the ethno-linguistic groups. Unfortunately, these are on the limit of extinction due to modernization and diversity of religion. However, efforts from the youth and education sector are joining forces in reviving long lost traditions, if not through the traditional means, through the surviving remnants of the Hispanic-influenced music which are undergoing a transformation into present day versions. Secular music of the lowlands of Luzon bears influences of Spanish culture and serves as reflections of that era, as seen in the messages of the songs. These songs, mostly about love of a man for a woman, have a deeper meaning for the Filipinos at that time. The man's longing for the love of a woman is transformed into the country's love and longing for a free Philippines, as embodied in the woman.​</a>

                                            Global free trade has done more harm than Good?  Explanation: Global free trade simply makes easier to buy and sell goods and services between nations. Where exporting and importing of goods, resources, services and technology has no limit and no restrictions includes taxes, bans and qoutas. This often leds to increased economic growth (stronger economic growth)  also means that more goods can be purchased internationally, which can help many people around the world access affordable and higher quality products. Both of two countries agreed in the marketing process that we would have been provided and we will also benefited. Global free trade provides more benefits for more cooperative, but for the poor this is a problem for their livelihood and can have a serious negative impacts to other local workers and markets frequently it may cause harm and damage to our economic estability especially to the workers. This may decrease competiveness in the market and may cost low demand for the commodities and service being trade can be avail at cheaper rate or price. We purchased goods and services that have low cost that makes disadvantages for the local markets and workers. These may result decrease demands, unemployment under played workers that outweigh the benefits of this global free trade. Sana makatulong,​</a>

                            5. What is Globalization?We often hear the word globalization in many contexts and repeated frequently as a concept to denote more trade, foreign companies, and even the ongoing economic crisis. Before we launch into a full-fledged review of the term and its various manifestations, we should consider what we mean when we say globalization.Globalization is the free movement of goods, services, and people across the world in a seamless and integrated manner. Globalization can be the result of the opening up of the global economy and the concomitant increase in trade between nations. In other words, when countries that were hitherto closed to trade and foreign investment open up their economies and go global, the result is increasing interconnectedness and integration of the world economies.Globalization can also mean that countries liberalize their import protocols and welcome foreign investment into sectors that are the mainstays of its economy. Globalization means that countries attract global capital by opening up their economies to multinational corporations. Globalization also means that countries liberalize their visa rules and procedures to permit the free flow of people from country to country. Globalization frees up the unproductive sectors to investment and the productive sectors to export-related activities resulting in a win-win situation for world economies.Source: https://www.managementstudyguide.com/what-is-globalization.htmAnswer the following questions:1.

                            15. The music for liturgy and devotional music of the lowlands of Luzon reflects the impact of Spanish colonization which lasted for almost three centuries, and how the Christianity affected the religious practices of the ethno-linguistic groups. Unfortunately, these are on the limit of extinction due to modernization and diversity of religion. However, efforts from the youth and education sector are joining forces in reviving long lost traditions, if not through the traditional means, through the surviving remnants of the Hispanic-influenced music which are undergoing a transformation into present day versions. Secular music of the lowlands of Luzon bears influences of Spanish culture and serves as reflections of that era, as seen in the messages of the songs. These songs, mostly about love of a man for a woman, have a deeper meaning for the Filipinos at that time. The man's longing for the love of a woman is transformed into the country's love and longing for a free Philippines, as embodied in the woman.​</h2><br />

                            30. Global free trade has done more harm than Good?  Explanation: Global free trade simply makes easier to buy and sell goods and services between nations. Where exporting and importing of goods, resources, services and technology has no limit and no restrictions includes taxes, bans and qoutas. This often leds to increased economic growth (stronger economic growth)  also means that more goods can be purchased internationally, which can help many people around the world access affordable and higher quality products. Both of two countries agreed in the marketing process that we would have been provided and we will also benefited. Global free trade provides more benefits for more cooperative, but for the poor this is a problem for their livelihood and can have a serious negative impacts to other local workers and markets frequently it may cause harm and damage to our economic estability especially to the workers. This may decrease competiveness in the market and may cost low demand for the commodities and service being trade can be avail at cheaper rate or price. We purchased goods and services that have low cost that makes disadvantages for the local markets and workers. These may result decrease demands, unemployment under played workers that outweigh the benefits of this global free trade. Sana makatulong,​</h2><br />
                        <strong>The Negative Impact of Global Free Trade </strong><p>Now that international or foreign brands may enter and exit the country so easily as a result of global free trade, we tend to have easier access to them (through online shopping). As a result of the high demand for international goods, citizens may eventually start to <strong>disregard</strong> the nation's own local products and economy.</p><p></p><p>Global free trade is taking place between various nations or jurisdictions where there are no limits or limitations on the import or export of commodities, resources, information, services, and technology, including taxes, prohibitions, and quotas. </p><p></p><p>Free trade may benefit our economy, but it frequently threatens its stability and causes harm, particularly to <strong>workers.</strong> This could reduce market competition and result in lower local demand for goods and services. Free trade may increase economic output and expand market opportunities. All the goods and services that are being traded can be had for less money. We choose to purchase items or services that are inexpensive, which is bad for local businesses and workers. These could lead to wage stagnation, declining demand, rising unemployment, and underpaid labor, which would negate the advantages of this global free trade.</p><p></p><p>According to this<strong> viewpoint,</strong> global free trade benefits more businesses, but for the poor, it poses a threat to their way of life and may have detrimental effects on other local employees and marketplaces.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about market here: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/17316809#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
