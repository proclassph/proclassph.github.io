It could be something as simple as a good meal with your family or perhaps, the last time you and your friends played sport. Recall the experience and examine how the memory of it makes you feel. Then, write a reflection on one of the most enduring philosophical inquiries “What is the meaning of happiness?” Cute instances from your experience as you remember it in backing up your claims. Write your answer on the separate sheet of paper.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the activities that I have enjoyed lately was playing online games with my friends. Whenever I think of this memory there are smiles on my lips because even though we haven’t seen each other for a long time due to quarantine restrictions we are still having bonding in a simple way. If I were to be asked what the meaning of happiness is, my answer would be simple. These are the things that make me happy and the happiness for me is simply having communication with my friends, siblings, parents, and other loved ones.</p><p></p><br />
