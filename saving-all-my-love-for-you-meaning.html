                                            Bringing to mind the fundamental approaches of CICM toward a unified mission, give at least two various vocation commitments you would like to carry out at the heart of a fruitful service and dedication in your future career and profession. Explain each briefly.Answer:GOD'S PLAN OF LOVE     God love his children and he care for us, for he is doing everything to help and save us from everything that might destroy us or hurt us. As a future pharmacist, I like to continue his plan of showing love and care to others in my own ways. We pharmacists must commit ourselves to our work, we must love and be true in this career that we choose. We must show our clients or patients our care for them, that all we want is to help them recover and make them feel better through out the treatment process. We are an instrument of God to fulfill his plan to show love and care to others, in a way that he send us to help and heal those people who are in struggle of sickness, who are in great pain of illness and others. We are to serve and save people's life that is our purpose, that is our mission as a future health care provider. And that is showing love to others by means of helping them and giving care for them to become better.COMMITMENT TO DIALOGUE     We must respect and accept the differences that all of us have like how we act or talk in front of other people. Afterall, we are not the same, we have lot of differences because we came from different places in the world following different cultures, beliefs, traditions, customs, languages and others. As a pharmacists, we must know how to approach or deal different kinds of patients or clients we are talking everyday. To avoid misunderstanding or any conflicts that might happen make sure to talk to them nicely, calmly and gently especially those patients having sensitive cases. We must build a good relationship with them by knowing important things about them. Also, those things we must avoid while communicating with them for them to feel secured and comfortable to you. Talk to them in a way that they will feel like you understand their situation, that you care for their recovery or that you want them to become better.</a>

                                            A Glass Of Milk A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?." "You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart." Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.1.

                                            Task 4 Read and Enjoy
The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.
Task 5 Analyze the situations based on the “Parable of Rainbow Colors” written by Juan M. Flavier. Choose which color of the rainbow shows the following scenario in our lives. 
1. The Frontliners are doing their bests to save lives. 
2. A soldier is dying in a battle because of love for country. 
3. A journalist has the power to change someone’s way of thinking. 
4. The farmers are very happy because of the good harvest this year. 
5. There are volunteers who planted plants and trees to save our forests.

A Glass of Milk 
A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?."
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart."
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness.
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room.
He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all.
Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

Explain each briefly.Answer:GOD'S PLAN OF LOVE     God love his children and he care for us, for he is doing everything to help and save us from everything that might destroy us or hurt us. As a future pharmacist, I like to continue his plan of showing love and care to others in my own ways. We pharmacists must commit ourselves to our work, we must love and be true in this career that we choose. We must show our clients or patients our care for them, that all we want is to help them recover and make them feel better through out the treatment process. We are an instrument of God to fulfill his plan to show love and care to others, in a way that he send us to help and heal those people who are in struggle of sickness, who are in great pain of illness and others. We are to serve and save people's life that is our purpose, that is our mission as a future health care provider. And that is showing love to others by means of helping them and giving care for them to become better.COMMITMENT TO DIALOGUE     We must respect and accept the differences that all of us have like how we act or talk in front of other people. Afterall, we are not the same, we have lot of differences because we came from different places in the world following different cultures, beliefs, traditions, customs, languages and others. As a pharmacists, we must know how to approach or deal different kinds of patients or clients we are talking everyday. To avoid misunderstanding or any conflicts that might happen make sure to talk to them nicely, calmly and gently especially those patients having sensitive cases. We must build a good relationship with them by knowing important things about them. Also, those things we must avoid while communicating with them for them to feel secured and comfortable to you. Talk to them in a way that they will feel like you understand their situation, that you care for their recovery or that you want them to become better.</h2><br />

However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?." "You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart." Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.1.

                            6. Task 4 Read and Enjoy
The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.
Task 5 Analyze the situations based on the “Parable of Rainbow Colors” written by Juan M. Flavier. Choose which color of the rainbow shows the following scenario in our lives. 
1. The Frontliners are doing their bests to save lives. 
2. A soldier is dying in a battle because of love for country. 
3. A journalist has the power to change someone’s way of thinking. 
4. The farmers are very happy because of the good harvest this year. 
5. There are volunteers who planted plants and trees to save our forests.
