                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The couple must seriously attend the seminars before getting married to fully understand how to handle having a family and also their relationship. They will strongly build a better foundation for their future family when they fully understand this. As what we have learned our lesson: Family planning is a preparation for responsible parenthood. When a couple agrees to practice this, they will only have the number of children they can afford to support. Therefore, there will be no unwanted pregnancy for the couple. They will still have enough time to enjoy each other’s company without having too many children to attend to.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO THANKYOUUU </p><p>HAVE A NICE DAY</p><p></p><p> PA BRAINLIEST PO THANKYOUUU </p><br />

RH Bill is proposed law in the Philippines aiming to guarantee universal access to methods on: Contraception, Fertility Control, Sexual Education Maternal Care. Though it has a good intention to minimized population, and to give a good future for the family. but still this Bill received different reactions and condemnations from the public and religious sectors. Christian community is against this bill for the reason that it is also against the will of God. The proposed Bill is clearly contradicts morality and other principles in the Bible but again it has a good intention for the betterment of the whole family especially children.  </p><p>
