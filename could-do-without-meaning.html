How do you think would Annie and her family endure this kind of family problem?
Annie was a Grade Four pupil. She always made sure to do her best
when it came to her studies. She also tries to help her little brother with
his homework every day after school. Annie's mother worked as an office
secretary while her father was a factory worker. Annie's family was living
a simple but happy life.
But one day, a tragedy struck Annie's family. Her father had an accident
at work. He was hospitalized because of the severity of the injuries to his
right leg. The doctor said that he would not be able to walk properly for
at least six months. This means that Annie's father would be without
work for some time.
This made Annie's family sad, especially her brother who loves playing
basketball with their father every Saturday. Now, Annie's brother no
longer wanted to go school. All he wanted was to be with his father and
take care of him. Even Annie's mother was affected by what happened.
Now, she always gets tired because of working extra hours to make up
for her husband's lost income</a>

Example:     Dear teacher,  It would be wonderful to choose our own seats and here’s why.         We could choose to sit away from those who are distracting us. It is very hard to me to focus when my seatmate, ask me questions every minute and tell jokes. Without these distractions, I could focus better on the discussion and seatwork.          Also, we would be much happier if we could choose our seats. Happier students are better behaved students and that’s a win-win for everyone. You don’t have to stop teaching to redirect us and we get better grades because we can focus.         You’re probably thinking that if you let us choose where we want to sit, then everybody would just sit with their friends. But I think that’s a weak argument because if we’re sitting next to someone who doesn’t like us and they’re mean to us, we will rebel and cause disruptions in class. All of us want to do well, and I believe that we are mature enough to choose a spot where we are sitting with someone we like but also can focus in class.

"Such insects are of no use to man, and had i the power , I would cause them to disappear from earth."One day, during a war, this prince was obliged or forced to flee or run away before the enemy. At night, being very much fatigued or tired, he lay down under a tree in the middle of a forest, and soon fell asleep, He as discovered by one of the enemy soldiers, who glided softly up to him,sword in hand, intending to kill him.At this moment, a fly suddenly alighted on the cheek of the prince and stung him so sharply that he awoke. He started up, dre his sword and fought with the soldier, and at last escaped. Then the prince went and hid himself in a cave in the same forest.During the night, a spider spun her thread across the entrance. Two soldiers who were in search of the fugitive prince, came so near that he could hear their conversation. "Look!" said one, "no doubt he is hidden here." "No," replied the other, "he could not have entered without tearing down the spider web."As soon as they had gone, the prince cried out with emotion, raising hands to heaven "O, my God! What a gratitude do i owe thee! Thou didst save my life yesterday by means of a fly, and today thou have preserved me by means of a spider. Truly, there are use and purpose in all the works of Thy creation."​</a>

                                            please,Write a concluding sentence for the following passage :
Patience is difined to be a person's ability to wait something out or endure something tedious, without getting riled up. It takes a lot of patience to wait for your braces to come off, to deal with a toddler's temper tantrum, or to build a house out of toothpicks. Having patience means you can remain calm, even when you've been waiting forever or dealing with something painstakingly slow or trying to teach someone how to do something and they just don't get it. It involves acceptance and tolerance, and is usually easier to have when there's something in it for you at the end. That could be a goal you've been slowly working to achieve, or just lower blood pressure.</a>

How do you think would Annie and her family endure this kind of family problem?
Annie was a Grade Four pupil. She always made sure to do her best
when it came to her studies. She also tries to help her little brother with
his homework every day after school. Annie's mother worked as an office
secretary while her father was a factory worker. Annie's family was living
a simple but happy life.
But one day, a tragedy struck Annie's family. Her father had an accident
at work. He was hospitalized because of the severity of the injuries to his
right leg. The doctor said that he would not be able to walk properly for
at least six months. This means that Annie's father would be without
work for some time.
This made Annie's family sad, especially her brother who loves playing
basketball with their father every Saturday. Now, Annie's brother no
longer wanted to go school. All he wanted was to be with his father and
take care of him. Even Annie's mother was affected by what happened.
Now, she always gets tired because of working extra hours to make up
for her husband's lost income</h2><br />

                            20.  pa answer po i will mark and follow you plsDirections: Using a letter, persuade your teacher why you should choose your own seats when we return to face to face classes.   Example:     Dear teacher,  It would be wonderful to choose our own seats and here’s why.         We could choose to sit away from those who are distracting us. It is very hard to me to focus when my seatmate, ask me questions every minute and tell jokes. Without these distractions, I could focus better on the discussion and seatwork.          Also, we would be much happier if we could choose our seats. Happier students are better behaved students and that’s a win-win for everyone. You don’t have to stop teaching to redirect us and we get better grades because we can focus.         You’re probably thinking that if you let us choose where we want to sit, then everybody would just sit with their friends. But I think that’s a weak argument because if we’re sitting next to someone who doesn’t like us and they’re mean to us, we will rebel and cause disruptions in class. All of us want to do well, and I believe that we are mature enough to choose a spot where we are sitting with someone we like but also can focus in class.

"Such insects are of no use to man, and had i the power , I would cause them to disappear from earth."One day, during a war, this prince was obliged or forced to flee or run away before the enemy. At night, being very much fatigued or tired, he lay down under a tree in the middle of a forest, and soon fell asleep, He as discovered by one of the enemy soldiers, who glided softly up to him,sword in hand, intending to kill him.At this moment, a fly suddenly alighted on the cheek of the prince and stung him so sharply that he awoke. He started up, dre his sword and fought with the soldier, and at last escaped. Then the prince went and hid himself in a cave in the same forest.During the night, a spider spun her thread across the entrance. Two soldiers who were in search of the fugitive prince, came so near that he could hear their conversation. "Look!" said one, "no doubt he is hidden here." "No," replied the other, "he could not have entered without tearing down the spider web."As soon as they had gone, the prince cried out with emotion, raising hands to heaven "O, my God! What a gratitude do i owe thee! Thou didst save my life yesterday by means of a fly, and today thou have preserved me by means of a spider. Truly, there are use and purpose in all the works of Thy creation."​</h2><br />

                            30. please,Write a concluding sentence for the following passage :
Patience is difined to be a person's ability to wait something out or endure something tedious, without getting riled up. It takes a lot of patience to wait for your braces to come off, to deal with a toddler's temper tantrum, or to build a house out of toothpicks. Having patience means you can remain calm, even when you've been waiting forever or dealing with something painstakingly slow or trying to teach someone how to do something and they just don't get it. It involves acceptance and tolerance, and is usually easier to have when there's something in it for you at the end. That could be a goal you've been slowly working to achieve, or just lower blood pressure.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As expressed it is frustrating and the feeling is not very nice, Though it is something to keep, the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, trouble, or suffering without getting angry or upset is hard to master but definitely worth improving in. We all are growing and learning to accept the worst to come and having to have a high level of patience is useful in the long run.  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
