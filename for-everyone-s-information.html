                                            2. Among the breakthroughs that happened throughout human history, it is perhaps digitization that best defines our current age. Since all sorts of information can now be represented by the numbers 1 and 0, contemporary Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are now able to store everything from books, movies, music and of course, everyone's classic favorite, games. And because of this one can see just about anyone playing games not only at the comfort of one's own home, as what was done back in the 80's and the 90's, but almost at any occasion: while on public transportation vehicle, listening to boring lecture, or even in between conversations. As a result, a new brand of gaming culture has been created, one that does not let up and takes every opportunity possible to play.​</a>

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY EVERYONE HAS FEELINGS Psychosocial Competency: Self-awareness and Self-expression (Individual work) ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION: This activity helps learners identify their feelings, express them through art, and discover that people can experience more than one feeling at a time. RECOVERY OBJECTIVE: Develop self-exploration and self-awareness, practice self-expression, as well as gain a sense of empathy toward others. LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Enhance vocabulary for naming feelings and practice abstract thinking by making associations between colors, shapes, lines, or images and feelings. MATERIALS NEEDED: Any paper available, markers, crayons, paints, other assorted materials. INSTRUCTIONS/GUIDE: Explore our feelings for today, sometimes, when we pay close attention to ourselves and give time to actually check in with how we are feeling, we might notice that we have more than one feeling at a time. Remember that is normal, especially in the time of a pandemic or disaster, and other transitions we might be going through. There are no right or wrong emotions and that paying attention to how we feel can give us information about ourselves and how we can handle situations. 1. Prepare piece of paper and coloring materials. 2. Settle and quiet down in own space on the floor. 3. Gently close your eyes and identify your feeling/s right now. 4. Open your eyes "How are you feeling today?" 5. On your sheet of paper, draw a picture with the colors that match the way you feel right now.​</a>

                                            Read the text and answer the questions that follow. After an earthquake, rescuers search for survivors under the rubble of fallen buildings. Every few minutes everyone stops what he or she is doing to listen very carefully. The rescuers are listening for shouts from survivors but more often they can hear tapping sounds when survivors tap stones or metal pipes. One person was rescued after 11 days trapped under rubble when the rescuers heard faint tapping sounds. The table shows the speeds of sound in different materials. + Material aluminium steel brick wood glycerol water mercury helium air carbon dioxide Speed of sound (m/s) 6400 5800 4200 3600 1900 1500 1450 970 340 260 Type of substance solid metal solid metal solid non-metal solid non-metal liquid liquid liquid metal gas gas gas Questions 1. State the speed of sound in air. Give the units. 2. State whether sound travel fastest in solids, liquids, or gases. 3. Explain why a sound travelling along a steel rod and an identical wooden rod reaches the end of the steel rod sooner. 4. Sounds travel through materials by passing vibrations from particle to particle. Particles in solids are very close together. They pass on vibrations better than particles in gases, which are far apart. Use this information to explain why tapping sounds from survivors after earthquakes travel better than shouting for help. II. Checkpoint: Choose the correct word from those in bold. A wave is a vibration that transfers energy/matter. The distance from the middle to the top of the wave is the amplitude/wavelength. The distance from one crest to the next crest is the amplitude/wavelength. Loudness depends on wavelength/amplitude. Sound waves are longitudinal/light waves, which means the vibration is in the same/ a different direction to that of the wave.​</a>

Since all sorts of information can now be represented by the numbers 1 and 0, contemporary Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are now able to store everything from books, movies, music and of course, everyone's classic favorite, games. And because of this one can see just about anyone playing games not only at the comfort of one's own home, as what was done back in the 80's and the 90's, but almost at any occasion: while on public transportation vehicle, listening to boring lecture, or even in between conversations. As a result, a new brand of gaming culture has been created, one that does not let up and takes every opportunity possible to play.​</h2><br />

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</h2><br />

                            7. ACTIVITY EVERYONE HAS FEELINGS Psychosocial Competency: Self-awareness and Self-expression (Individual work) ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION: This activity helps learners identify their feelings, express them through art, and discover that people can experience more than one feeling at a time. RECOVERY OBJECTIVE: Develop self-exploration and self-awareness, practice self-expression, as well as gain a sense of empathy toward others. LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Enhance vocabulary for naming feelings and practice abstract thinking by making associations between colors, shapes, lines, or images and feelings. MATERIALS NEEDED: Any paper available, markers, crayons, paints, other assorted materials. INSTRUCTIONS/GUIDE: Explore our feelings for today, sometimes, when we pay close attention to ourselves and give time to actually check in with how we are feeling, we might notice that we have more than one feeling at a time. Remember that is normal, especially in the time of a pandemic or disaster, and other transitions we might be going through. There are no right or wrong emotions and that paying attention to how we feel can give us information about ourselves and how we can handle situations. 1. Prepare piece of paper and coloring materials. 2. Settle and quiet down in own space on the floor. 3. Gently close your eyes and identify your feeling/s right now. 4. Open your eyes "How are you feeling today?" 5. On your sheet of paper, draw a picture with the colors that match the way you feel right now.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Blue </strong>is the color I decided to use today to symbolize my emotions. I simply feel at <strong>calm </strong>and <strong>content </strong>for the day, and I don't believe anything noteworthy or unusual occurred. I chose the color blue because it is calming to the eyes and to the soul on a day like this one, which is simply another typical day for me. My daily schedule consists of getting up, going to school, listening to and studying the lessons my instructor assigns, eating when it's time to eat, and then leaving for home after class. I will then eat dinner with my family and go to bed. And I think that's all.</p><p></p><p>Because I have no expectations of anyone or anything, I feel <strong>content </strong>for the time being. "Come what may," according to the quote, merely makes me feel comfortable and at peace. Whatever occurs will occur. Simply said, I prefer not to invite too many feelings on this day. I kind of like not wanting to feel happy or sad on this particular day. Simply serene and content And for me, that's sufficient.</p><p></p><p>To learn more, just click the link below:</p><p>brainly.ph/question/29256451</p><p>brainly.ph/question/29213378</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                            22. Read the text and answer the questions that follow. After an earthquake, rescuers search for survivors under the rubble of fallen buildings. Every few minutes everyone stops what he or she is doing to listen very carefully. The rescuers are listening for shouts from survivors but more often they can hear tapping sounds when survivors tap stones or metal pipes. One person was rescued after 11 days trapped under rubble when the rescuers heard faint tapping sounds. The table shows the speeds of sound in different materials. + Material aluminium steel brick wood glycerol water mercury helium air carbon dioxide Speed of sound (m/s) 6400 5800 4200 3600 1900 1500 1450 970 340 260 Type of substance solid metal solid metal solid non-metal solid non-metal liquid liquid liquid metal gas gas gas Questions 1. State the speed of sound in air. Give the units. 2. State whether sound travel fastest in solids, liquids, or gases. 3. Explain why a sound travelling along a steel rod and an identical wooden rod reaches the end of the steel rod sooner. 4. Sounds travel through materials by passing vibrations from particle to particle. Particles in solids are very close together. They pass on vibrations better than particles in gases, which are far apart. Use this information to explain why tapping sounds from survivors after earthquakes travel better than shouting for help. II. Checkpoint: Choose the correct word from those in bold. A wave is a vibration that transfers energy/matter. The distance from the middle to the top of the wave is the amplitude/wavelength. The distance from one crest to the next crest is the amplitude/wavelength. Loudness depends on wavelength/amplitude. Sound waves are longitudinal/light waves, which means the vibration is in the same/ a different direction to that of the wave.​</h2><br />
