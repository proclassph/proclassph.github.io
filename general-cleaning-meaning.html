Recycling glass reduces the space in landfills that would otherwise be taken up by used bottles and jars. Using glass for recycling means there are less glass objects lying around in he landfill or bin There's some air pollution, too. Sulphur oxides are released during the melting process, and nitrogen oxides are generated if the glass is heated by burning gas. So although we tend to think of glass as a 'clean' product, it has its drawbacks​</a>

This is because the future generation needs a safe placeto live in. With this, it is critical for the society to embrace all the possible means ofenvironmental preservation, recycling is among the means of ensuring a safe hub for thegenerations to come. When recycling is discussed, it brings into focus the idea of reduce,reuse and recycle. Recycling can impact a positive environment since the surroundings willbe clean and devoid of waste materials that can pollute the environment. Despite all the abovefacts, it is important to note that recycling has both its advantages and disadvantages. Themerit is that it positively impacts the environment while the demerit is that it may lead to thenproduction of chemicals that are destructive to the environment. Therefore, it is clear thathuman beings must shed off the limitations linked to recycling in order to ensure a positivempact on the environment.II.READING DISCUSSION​</a>

Recycling, why is it important?
Recycling is important to be done. It will promote a clean and healthy environment to live in. The rubbish we throw away everyday can creates waste. Recycling means that there is less rubbish, which makes our environment cleaner and healthier. Besides, recycling saves raw materials. The more we recycle, the few raw materials we need. Definitely, it can help to save wild places and the animals that they live in them. Recycling papers, for example, means that fewer timber forests are needed. As stewards of the environment, we are responsible for preserving and protecting our resources. We should take care our environment not only for ourselves but for future generations. Based on the reasons stated above, I believe that recycling is really important to be done now.</a>

This is because the future generation needs a safe placeto live in. With this, it is critical for the society to embrace all the possible means ofenvironmental preservation, recycling is among the means of ensuring a safe hub for thegenerations to come. When recycling is discussed, it brings into focus the idea of reduce,reuse and recycle. Recycling can impact a positive environment since the surroundings willbe clean and devoid of waste materials that can pollute the environment. Despite all the abovefacts, it is important to note that recycling has both its advantages and disadvantages. Themerit is that it positively impacts the environment while the demerit is that it may lead to thenproduction of chemicals that are destructive to the environment. Therefore, it is clear thathuman beings must shed off the limitations linked to recycling in order to ensure a positivempact on the environment.II.READING DISCUSSION​</h2><br />
