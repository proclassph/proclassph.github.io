                                            synthesized or not?3. Mulan, a 1988 Disney animated movie is about Fa Mulan who joined the army disguised as her ailing father to save his life. It tells about her exploits as an army and how she helped save her country and the Emperor from the enemy. As the movie unfolds, I come to realize interesting things about Mulan. Like, she is a perfect example of a feminist. She breaks the gender limitations set by her society. In addition, she is not afraid to show her true self even if it means disappointing her family. However, what impresses me more about Mulan is her selflessness. Out of her love for her father and her family, she goes to war in his stead regardless of the severe punishment waiting once her disguise would be uncovered.​</a>

This spiritual work of mercy is based on fraternal correction which was observed by the early Christians 2. Jesus tells us, "But I shall see you again, then your hearts will rejoice with joy no one can take from you" (Jn 16-22) 3. A truly loving Christian Community needs people to be together for better or for worse 4. Bearing wrong patiently further includes wishing for the transformation of our wrongdoers 5. Since Christ suffered for you in just this way and left you an example, so have you follow in his footsteps" peter 2:19-21) 6. Revenge is indeed dangerous although it appears sweet to those who were wronged 7. St Paul tells us "Because you are God's chosen ones, holy and beloved clothe yourself with heartfelt mercy, kindness and patience. 8 Forgive one another as the Lord has forgiven you (Col 3:12) 9. Prayer is a sign of humility and acknowledgement that God rules our lives. 10. Present your needs to God in every form of prayer and petition full of gratitude 11. Patience means waiting for the right time when to fight for justice. 12. Love is the ultimate indicator of the fulfilment of God's Kingdom 13. We care for people, it means we love them​</a>

                                            Who’s the Thief?" by Mendy Kaminker Three angry men presented themselves in King Solomon’s court. “Your Majesty,” said the first, “the three of us are business partners. We went together on a business trip with a large sum of money.” The second picked up the story. “Shortly before Shabbat, we hid the money in a pit we’d dug, planning to dig it up right after Shabbat.” King Solomon listened attentively. It was gone! “But when we went for it, it was gone!” said the third. “No one knew about it but us. One of us is a thief! My lord, I’d like for you to have each of us swear that he didn’t steal the money. That way we’ll find out which of us is the thief!” But King Solomon was in no hurry to do that. He knew that the man who stole the money would also lie and swear falsely. How could he find out which of them was guilty? “Return to me tomorrow,” he told the three. When the partners presented themselves the next day, King Solomon said, “I can see that you three are wise men. Before we discuss your case, I would like your opinion about a different matter.” King Solomon’s flattery worked like magic, and they waited eagerly to hear his problem. “A boy and a girl grew up together, and swore to each other that when they were old enough, they would become husband and wife. At very least, they decided, they’d ask the other’s permission before marrying anyone else. “Years passed. The girl, forgetting her oath, married someone else. Immediately after the wedding, she remembered her earlier commitment and told her husband about it. He said, ‘We can’t live as husband and wife until we find that boy and ask him to annul the oath that you swore to each other!’ “They took a large sum of money and set out to find her childhood friend. They found him and offered to pay him to annul the oath, but he was a good man, so he wished them a hearty mazal tov and refused the money. “On their way home, the happy new couple was robbed. ‘Please give us back the money,’ the woman pleaded. She told the robber about how good her husband was, being so patient as to let her take care of her oath before they moved in together, and how good the boy she’d grown up with was for refusing to take the money. The robber was touched, and returned the purse.” King Solomon looked at the three men, who couldn’t understand where all this was leading. “My question is, which of the people in this story was the most praiseworthy?” asked the king. One of the partners said, “The wife is the most admirable. She kept an oath she made when she was just a girl!” The second partner said, “Her husband is the most praiseworthy. Although he loved his wife, he left home right after his wedding to find that boy, and allowed himself to act as a husband to her only after she was released from her oath.” The last partner said, “Its true, both of them behaved in an exemplary fashion. But the boy was a fool! Why didn’t he take the money when they offered it to him?” “You are the thief!” “You are the thief!” King Solomon bellowed, pointing to the last partner. “When you talk that way about the boy, you show that you have an appetite for money even if you have no right to it. I’m convinced that you stole the money from your partners.” The last partner admitted his guilt, and the other two went home satisfied and impressed by the wisdom of King Solomon1. What wisdom you can get from the story? *2. What does it mean to be praiseworthy? Based from the story, who was the most trustworthy?3. If you are King Solomon how will you 5 points solve the problem? What will be your strategy in identifying the thief?​</a>

If you were in his shoes, would you have the same convictions? Explain.Speech:The Filipino is worth Dying For Benigno Simeon AquinoI have spent almost eight long and lonely years in military confinement. The problem of Martial Rule and its injustices have nagged me all these years.During those eight years, I learned the true meaning of humiliation of courage, of hunger and endless anxiety. Rather than be bitter I have learned to accept my suffering as a Department of Education Republic of the Philippinescleansing process and a rare opportunity to really grapple with the problems of the Filipino.I have asked myself many times: Is the Filipino worth suffering, or even dying, for? Is he not a coward who would readily yield to any colonizer, be he foreign or home-grown? Is a Filipino more comfortable under an authoritarian leader because he does not want to be burdened with the freedom of choice? Is he unprepared or, worse, ill- suited for presidential or parliamentary democracy?I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for because he is the nation's greatest untapped resource.He is not a coward. He values life and he tends to give his leader the maximum benefit of the doubt. Given a good leader, because he is a good follower, the Filipino can attain great heights.It would seem that he is more comfortable in being told to do than to think for himself. But this is only a superficial impression because deep down in his being, he loves freedom but puts the highest premium on human life and human dignity. Hence, he would try to adapt till his patience runs out.Is the Filipino prepared for democracy? Definitely. Even before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistador, he had already practiced participatory democracy in his barangay. He values his freedom, but because he values human life more, he will not easily take up arms and would rather wait till his patience runs outYes, I have gained valuable insights in prison and like an average Filipino, I would like to tell Mr. Marcos this:I can forgive you for what you have done to me over the last eight years because this I can do, but I can never forgive you for depriving our people of their freedom because it not mine to forgive.took away from us on that night of September 21, 1972. Like the average Filipino, please do not mistake my patience for docility, my conciliatory demeanor for cowardice and lack of will.I have chosen to suffer long years of solitary confinement rather than urge my followers to put our country to the torch because, like the average Filipino. I put the highest value on human life. And I dread the weeping of mothers whose sons will surely be sacrificed at the altar of revolution. But please do not misinterpret this conduct for timidity and subservience.I have faced death a couple of times in prison. In 1975, I went on a hunger strike for forty days and forty nights and I was near death when your jailers rushed me to the Veterans Hospital.I faced death in your detention camp when your army doctors diagnosed my heart ailment as mere muscle spasm, only to be told by doctors in the United States that I could have died from the heart attacks while I was languishing in your jail.Mr. Marcos: Please believe me when I tell you that, like the average Filipino, I will again willingly face death in a freedom struggle if you will not heed the voice of conscience and moderation.You were a soldier once, and you have repeatedly said, many times, it is an honor to die for one's country and for one's freedom.I hope you will now believe in what you preach and I pray that you shall at last desist from further trying the patience and resolve of your countrymen.Mr. Marcos: Give us back our freedom or suffer the consequences of your arrogance.​</a>

Most people who first see the landscape in pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not man-made. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which at the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that the name Chocolate Hills was derived. Be amazed with its beauty. Book now and travel to Bohol with your family!________2. The crocodile and the alligator are cousins. They both live in water and on land. They almost look alike but with a little difference. The crocodile has a narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer._________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat, sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring an umbrella or pack up a raincoat.___________4. A cat is the perfect pet.

Many years ago, there was a small family in Japan. There lived a father, mother
and their little daughter. They took their daughter to the temple when she was only
thirty days old wearing a long kimono like all Japanese babies do. The parents gave
the baby a set of beautiful dolls on her first doll festival, and when their daughter turned
three, she was no longer a baby but a little girl fast growing up. She was loved by her
parents very much. One day, a messenger came and brought news that the father is
needed by the Emperor to Tokyo. They haven’t had a horse so the father will need to
walk the long way. The mother and the little daughter bid farewell to the father and
promised him that they will take care of each other and will wait for him. After many
days, the father came back and brought the mother and daughter presents. The little
girl received a doll and she was very glad while the mother was amazed by the present.
It was a thing which she saw a beautiful face of a woman. The husband laughed and
told her it was a mirror and she only saw her own reflection. He told her that if she
brings a smile to the mirror, she will see a smiling face and if she didn’t it will reflect
the mirror. The wife thanked her husband and promised that she will always bring a
smiling face to the mirror. She often looked at the mirror and does what she had
promised. She would always see a happy face in it. Many years passed and she grew
tired of looking at it. She decided to give the precious gift to her daughter who grew
into a woman exactly like her mother. One day, she called the daughter and gave a
beautiful box, and the daughter was surprised of what she saw. It was the image of
her mother inside the round shiny thing. It was the image of her mother she used to
look at when she was a little girl. The mother told her to smile every time she will look
at her inside the mirror and assured her that she will smile back. For that day on, the
daughter kept the box near her. Once each year, she opened it and proved that her
mother’s words was always true. Always she saw her mother’s smiling face when she
smiles at her. The daughter always remembers to bring smiles to the thing inside the
little box, and always the smiles come back at her.

"To your mother dear,And bring her heart to me.Without another word,Youth left and went to his mother dear.He opened her breast and took her heart!But he did not shed a tear.Then back to his Maiden fair,He run unmindful of the rain.But his feet slipped, And he fell down,And loud, he groaned with pain!Still in his hand he held the prize,That would win his Maiden's hands.But he thought of his mother dear,So kind,so sweet,so fond.And then,he heard a voice!Not from his lips,But all apart!"Get up" it said."Were you hurt,Child?"It was his mother's heartThink it through 1.

It tells about her exploits as an army and how she helped save her country and the Emperor from the enemy. As the movie unfolds, I come to realize interesting things about Mulan. Like, she is a perfect example of a feminist. She breaks the gender limitations set by her society. In addition, she is not afraid to show her true self even if it means disappointing her family. However, what impresses me more about Mulan is her selflessness. Out of her love for her father and her family, she goes to war in his stead regardless of the severe punishment waiting once her disguise would be uncovered.​</h2><br />

Jesus tells us, "But I shall see you again, then your hearts will rejoice with joy no one can take from you" (Jn 16-22) 3. A truly loving Christian Community needs people to be together for better or for worse 4. Bearing wrong patiently further includes wishing for the transformation of our wrongdoers 5.

Prayer is a sign of humility and acknowledgement that God rules our lives. 10. Present your needs to God in every form of prayer and petition full of gratitude 11.

                            5. Who’s the Thief?" by Mendy Kaminker Three angry men presented themselves in King Solomon’s court. “Your Majesty,” said the first, “the three of us are business partners. We went together on a business trip with a large sum of money.” The second picked up the story. “Shortly before Shabbat, we hid the money in a pit we’d dug, planning to dig it up right after Shabbat.” King Solomon listened attentively. It was gone! “But when we went for it, it was gone!” said the third. “No one knew about it but us. One of us is a thief! My lord, I’d like for you to have each of us swear that he didn’t steal the money. That way we’ll find out which of us is the thief!” But King Solomon was in no hurry to do that. He knew that the man who stole the money would also lie and swear falsely. How could he find out which of them was guilty? “Return to me tomorrow,” he told the three. When the partners presented themselves the next day, King Solomon said, “I can see that you three are wise men. Before we discuss your case, I would like your opinion about a different matter.” King Solomon’s flattery worked like magic, and they waited eagerly to hear his problem. “A boy and a girl grew up together, and swore to each other that when they were old enough, they would become husband and wife. At very least, they decided, they’d ask the other’s permission before marrying anyone else. “Years passed. The girl, forgetting her oath, married someone else. Immediately after the wedding, she remembered her earlier commitment and told her husband about it. He said, ‘We can’t live as husband and wife until we find that boy and ask him to annul the oath that you swore to each other!’ “They took a large sum of money and set out to find her childhood friend. They found him and offered to pay him to annul the oath, but he was a good man, so he wished them a hearty mazal tov and refused the money. “On their way home, the happy new couple was robbed. ‘Please give us back the money,’ the woman pleaded. She told the robber about how good her husband was, being so patient as to let her take care of her oath before they moved in together, and how good the boy she’d grown up with was for refusing to take the money. The robber was touched, and returned the purse.” King Solomon looked at the three men, who couldn’t understand where all this was leading. “My question is, which of the people in this story was the most praiseworthy?” asked the king. One of the partners said, “The wife is the most admirable. She kept an oath she made when she was just a girl!” The second partner said, “Her husband is the most praiseworthy. Although he loved his wife, he left home right after his wedding to find that boy, and allowed himself to act as a husband to her only after she was released from her oath.” The last partner said, “Its true, both of them behaved in an exemplary fashion. But the boy was a fool! Why didn’t he take the money when they offered it to him?” “You are the thief!” “You are the thief!” King Solomon bellowed, pointing to the last partner. “When you talk that way about the boy, you show that you have an appetite for money even if you have no right to it. I’m convinced that you stole the money from your partners.” The last partner admitted his guilt, and the other two went home satisfied and impressed by the wisdom of King Solomon1. What wisdom you can get from the story? *2. What does it mean to be praiseworthy? Based from the story, who was the most trustworthy?3. If you are King Solomon how will you 5 points solve the problem? What will be your strategy in identifying the thief?​</h2><br />

                            7. 1. How does the speaker describe his countrymen?2. How does the speaker regard himself as a Filipino?3. If you were in his shoes, would you have the same convictions? Explain.Speech:The Filipino is worth Dying For Benigno Simeon AquinoI have spent almost eight long and lonely years in military confinement. The problem of Martial Rule and its injustices have nagged me all these years.During those eight years, I learned the true meaning of humiliation of courage, of hunger and endless anxiety. Rather than be bitter I have learned to accept my suffering as a Department of Education Republic of the Philippinescleansing process and a rare opportunity to really grapple with the problems of the Filipino.I have asked myself many times: Is the Filipino worth suffering, or even dying, for? Is he not a coward who would readily yield to any colonizer, be he foreign or home-grown? Is a Filipino more comfortable under an authoritarian leader because he does not want to be burdened with the freedom of choice? Is he unprepared or, worse, ill- suited for presidential or parliamentary democracy?I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for because he is the nation's greatest untapped resource.He is not a coward. He values life and he tends to give his leader the maximum benefit of the doubt. Given a good leader, because he is a good follower, the Filipino can attain great heights.It would seem that he is more comfortable in being told to do than to think for himself. But this is only a superficial impression because deep down in his being, he loves freedom but puts the highest premium on human life and human dignity. Hence, he would try to adapt till his patience runs out.Is the Filipino prepared for democracy? Definitely. Even before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistador, he had already practiced participatory democracy in his barangay. He values his freedom, but because he values human life more, he will not easily take up arms and would rather wait till his patience runs outYes, I have gained valuable insights in prison and like an average Filipino, I would like to tell Mr. Marcos this:I can forgive you for what you have done to me over the last eight years because this I can do, but I can never forgive you for depriving our people of their freedom because it not mine to forgive.took away from us on that night of September 21, 1972. Like the average Filipino, please do not mistake my patience for docility, my conciliatory demeanor for cowardice and lack of will.I have chosen to suffer long years of solitary confinement rather than urge my followers to put our country to the torch because, like the average Filipino. I put the highest value on human life. And I dread the weeping of mothers whose sons will surely be sacrificed at the altar of revolution. But please do not misinterpret this conduct for timidity and subservience.I have faced death a couple of times in prison. In 1975, I went on a hunger strike for forty days and forty nights and I was near death when your jailers rushed me to the Veterans Hospital.I faced death in your detention camp when your army doctors diagnosed my heart ailment as mere muscle spasm, only to be told by doctors in the United States that I could have died from the heart attacks while I was languishing in your jail.Mr. Marcos: Please believe me when I tell you that, like the average Filipino, I will again willingly face death in a freedom struggle if you will not heed the voice of conscience and moderation.You were a soldier once, and you have repeatedly said, many times, it is an honor to die for one's country and for one's freedom.I hope you will now believe in what you preach and I pray that you shall at last desist from further trying the patience and resolve of your countrymen.Mr. Marcos: Give us back our freedom or suffer the consequences of your arrogance.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The speaker describes his countrymen as worth dying for. An untapped resource. The Filipino men are described as free from constraints but are willing to surrender if it benefits his/her land. But, if they find injustice and abuse from the system, they would not be afraid to seek justice and peace.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>2. The speaker regards himself as a Filipino who's forgiving, patient, and has good will. But most importantly, he regards himself as a Filipino who has a deep love for his country.</p><p></p><p>3. If I were to suffer and live the way the speaker has. I would show hostility rather than seek peace and forgiveness. It may make me sound bitter, but I still haven't reached the point in life where I can afford to give forgiveness to whoever has wronged me. But in the end, I applaud the speaker's action. He seeks justice not through violence, but with peace.</p><br />

Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol’s most famous tourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not man-made. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which at the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that the name Chocolate Hills was derived. Be amazed with its beauty. Book now and travel to Bohol with your family!________2. The crocodile and the alligator are cousins. They both live in water and on land. They almost look alike but with a little difference. The crocodile has a narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer._________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat, sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring an umbrella or pack up a raincoat.___________4. A cat is the perfect pet. Cats are really so cute. They make people happy by petting. It reduces stress because they are calm. Having a cat will be easy. Iwill feed the cat. Yosef can help me clean the litter box.

                            12. Read carefully the excerpt from the story “The Happy Mirror”. The do the activities that follow.
Many years ago, there was a small family in Japan. There lived a father, mother
and their little daughter. They took their daughter to the temple when she was only
thirty days old wearing a long kimono like all Japanese babies do. The parents gave
the baby a set of beautiful dolls on her first doll festival, and when their daughter turned
three, she was no longer a baby but a little girl fast growing up. She was loved by her
parents very much. One day, a messenger came and brought news that the father is
needed by the Emperor to Tokyo. They haven’t had a horse so the father will need to
walk the long way. The mother and the little daughter bid farewell to the father and
promised him that they will take care of each other and will wait for him. After many
days, the father came back and brought the mother and daughter presents. The little
girl received a doll and she was very glad while the mother was amazed by the present.
It was a thing which she saw a beautiful face of a woman. The husband laughed and
told her it was a mirror and she only saw her own reflection. He told her that if she
brings a smile to the mirror, she will see a smiling face and if she didn’t it will reflect
the mirror. The wife thanked her husband and promised that she will always bring a
smiling face to the mirror. She often looked at the mirror and does what she had
promised. She would always see a happy face in it. Many years passed and she grew
tired of looking at it. She decided to give the precious gift to her daughter who grew
into a woman exactly like her mother. One day, she called the daughter and gave a
beautiful box, and the daughter was surprised of what she saw. It was the image of
her mother inside the round shiny thing. It was the image of her mother she used to
look at when she was a little girl. The mother told her to smile every time she will look
at her inside the mirror and assured her that she will smile back. For that day on, the
daughter kept the box near her. Once each year, she opened it and proved that her
mother’s words was always true. Always she saw her mother’s smiling face when she
smiles at her. The daughter always remembers to bring smiles to the thing inside the
little box, and always the smiles come back at her.

                            13. EVALUATION:
DIRECTIONS: Read each text carefully and distinguish the persuasive-text type. Write YES if
it persuades and NO if it does not. Write your answer before the number.
________1. Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol’s
most famous tourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in
pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not manmade. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the
construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which at
the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that
the name Chocolate Hills was derived. Be amazed with its beauty.
Book now and travel to Bohol with your family!
________2. The crocodile and the alligator are cousins. They both live in water and
on land. They almost look alike but with a little difference. The crocodile has a
narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The
crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat
turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any
kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer.
_________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They
are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The
three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are
clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A
few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds
called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat,
sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus
clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the
house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring
an umbrella or pack up a raincoat.
___________4. A cat is the perfect pet. Cats are really so cute. They make people happy
by petting. It reduces stress because they are calm. Having a cat will be easy. I
will feed the cat. Yosef can help me clean the litter box. We will help together
to feed Snow. A cat would make for the perfect pet. Please get me a cat, Mom
and Dad!
__________5. Do you love the nature? Well, grab a ticket now to see African Cats. You

                            16. BALLAD OF A MOTHER'S HEART BY JOSE LA VILLA TIERRAThe night was dark,For the moon was young,And the Stars were asleep and rare,The clouds were thick,Yet Youth went out,To see his Maiden fair.Dear one,he pleaded as he knelt before her feet in tears.My love is true,Why you have kept me waiting all this years?The maiden looked at him.Unmoved it seemed,And whispered low.Persistent Youth,You have to prove by deeds,Your love is true."There's not a thingI would not do for you, Beloved" said he."Then, go." said she. "To your mother dear,And bring her heart to me.Without another word,Youth left and went to his mother dear.He opened her breast and took her heart!But he did not shed a tear.Then back to his Maiden fair,He run unmindful of the rain.But his feet slipped, And he fell down,And loud, he groaned with pain!Still in his hand he held the prize,That would win his Maiden's hands.But he thought of his mother dear,So kind,so sweet,so fond.And then,he heard a voice!Not from his lips,But all apart!"Get up" it said."Were you hurt,Child?"It was his mother's heartThink it through 1. In the first stanza, what kind of night is being described?2. The boy professed, “there’s not a thing i would not do for you, beloved.” Will you do the same for the one you love?3. The girl asked her suitor “ go to your mother dear and bring her heart to me.” Based on the statement above, what does the girl really mean?4. If you were the young lover in the poem, would you do the same act of killing your own mother for your own happiness?5. Can you remember a perosnal experience signifying the love that your mother has for you?6. In your own perspective, what do you think is the message of the poem?#respect#carryonlearning</h2><br />

When you have a healthy sense of <strong>self-love, self-esteem, </strong>and<strong> self-compassion</strong>, you probably aren't looking for someone to "complete" you. Instead, you need someone who makes you better.</p><p></p><p>3. It is possible that she intends to gain the <strong>support</strong> of the suitor for both her and her lover.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>No, I won't. </strong>Not blaming others for your sadness is a personal responsibility. It is being pleased despite others' (bad) actions and environmental situations.</p><p></p><p>5. Being pregnant with me for a total of nine months, during which time <strong>Mom</strong> took care of me despite the fact that she was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>6. That we should have <strong>love for our mother</strong> and<strong> not be selfish</strong>, yes, we also need our own happiness, but it is not the correct way to give your mother's life simply to have support for you and your partner.</p><p></p>Further explanation:Happiness?<p>People often think that the most important part of their lives is the relationships they have. Spending time with people makes us happy every day, and having close friends protects us from bad moods that come from pain.</p><p></p>How does a mother love her child?<p>In addition to pampering her child, a mother's love consists of imparting <strong>moral</strong> and<strong> cultural values </strong>to her child. A good upbringing leads to a better future, and a mother does an amazing job of providing her child with the finest possible future.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about the poem here: https://brainly.ph/question/6894989#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
