                                            Last Monday, I was swinging from my favorite tree branch. I don't mean to brag, but I am an excellent tree swinger. The sky was a magnificent blue and there wasn't a cloud to be such. The air was filled with the wonderful aroma of spring What a perfect day to be outside. And so, there I was, swinging happily from the great oak tree, when suddenly, S-N-A-P! I experienced the sharpest pain I've ever felt. Right then and there, I realized I should have listened to my father's advice. He warned me that the branch couldnt support me. The branch cracked in two. And so did the bone in my arm when I hit the ground. I let out an earsplitting scream and my mother came running. The pain was unbearable! When we arrived at the emergency room, the doctor set my arm and sent us on our way. My arm doesn't hurt anymore, but it itches the cast. Next time, 111 listen to the words of wisdom.

                                            Why Houseplants are the Perfect Valentine's Day Gift
The Beatles sang “money can’t buy me love” but do you think they’d say the same thing about
houseplants and love?
If your partner or crush is a lover of all things green and leafy, then we bet they’d be thrilled
with getting a houseplant for Valentine’s Day. And even if they’re not a convert yet, now is a
good time to get them hooked to the plant gene. It’s early spring for most of us, and this is the
perfect time to bring a new houseplant home.
Sure, you can always default to red roses for a grand Valentine’s Day gesture, but let us try to
change your mind. Here's why houseplants make for much better gifts than cut flowers, plus
a few ideas of low-maintenance and romantic houseplants to get you started!
1.Houseplants last longer
Ok, this is obvious. But we’re trying to slowly ease into advocating for houseplants. The
average life of a bouquet of cut flowers is about a week. Some bouquets come with plant feed
that might stretch that to ten days. After that, it’s bye-bye flowers!
Houseplants last much longer. Even the blackest of thumbs can’t manage to kill a plant in a
week (don’t take that as a challenge though!). Houseplants may last for years as a good
reminder for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift.
2. Houseplants are often cheaper
We bet this one is not so obvious, right? You may think of houseplants as an investment. And
some of them are (especially rare specimens). But you can easily find houseplants that cost
10 dollars, and we’re not talking about runts. Prices are going down as the popularity of
houseplants is going up, so even a trip to your local plant nursery won’t break the bank.
3. Houseplants are more environmentally friendly
Most people don’t realize the environmental footprint of the fresh flower industry. That’s
because we tend to associate flowers with nature, and nature can do no wrong, right?
What I Can Do
21
Well, not until it’s exploited for profit at a massive scale. Most cut flowers are grown year-round
in greenhouses and fields heavily laden with pesticides. In the United States, most fresh
flowersare imported. And because the flowers are already cut (so pretty much dead), they are
shipped long distances in refrigerated containers that take a lot of energy to stay cool.
There is also a lot of waste in the flower industry because we all want perfect-looking flowers
with zero blemishes. And not to mention the waste caused by the flowers being thrown away
en-masse if the supermarket can’t sell them within the short window when they look nice and
perky. We’re not saying that houseplants have a zero-carbon footprint. But they are definitely
the more responsible choice for eco-conscious Valentines.
4. Houseplants send a message
Now that we got the practical reasons out of the way, let’s talk a bit about the sentimental
symbolism. When you give someone a houseplant, the underlying message is this: I think
you’re a responsible person. I think you can nurture and take care of something. And you can
count on me because I’ll be around to help. Maybe in not so many words. But the sentiment
is there!
If your partner is already someone who loves houseplants, then offering them another plant
for their collection shows that you care about their interests and hobbies. And you get extra
bonus points for being a good listener if they’ve already hinted that they wouldn’t mind another
green friend, and you deliver.

                            4. Last Monday, I was swinging from my favorite tree branch. I don't mean to brag, but I am an excellent tree swinger. The sky was a magnificent blue and there wasn't a cloud to be such. The air was filled with the wonderful aroma of spring What a perfect day to be outside. And so, there I was, swinging happily from the great oak tree, when suddenly, S-N-A-P! I experienced the sharpest pain I've ever felt. Right then and there, I realized I should have listened to my father's advice. He warned me that the branch couldnt support me. The branch cracked in two. And so did the bone in my arm when I hit the ground. I let out an earsplitting scream and my mother came running. The pain was unbearable! When we arrived at the emergency room, the doctor set my arm and sent us on our way. My arm doesn't hurt anymore, but it itches the cast. Next time, 111 listen to the words of wisdom.

                            5. Why Houseplants are the Perfect Valentine's Day Gift
The Beatles sang “money can’t buy me love” but do you think they’d say the same thing about
houseplants and love?
If your partner or crush is a lover of all things green and leafy, then we bet they’d be thrilled
with getting a houseplant for Valentine’s Day. And even if they’re not a convert yet, now is a
good time to get them hooked to the plant gene. It’s early spring for most of us, and this is the
perfect time to bring a new houseplant home.
Sure, you can always default to red roses for a grand Valentine’s Day gesture, but let us try to
change your mind. Here's why houseplants make for much better gifts than cut flowers, plus
a few ideas of low-maintenance and romantic houseplants to get you started!
1.Houseplants last longer
Ok, this is obvious. But we’re trying to slowly ease into advocating for houseplants. The
average life of a bouquet of cut flowers is about a week. Some bouquets come with plant feed
that might stretch that to ten days. After that, it’s bye-bye flowers!
Houseplants last much longer. Even the blackest of thumbs can’t manage to kill a plant in a
week (don’t take that as a challenge though!). Houseplants may last for years as a good
reminder for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift.
2. Houseplants are often cheaper
We bet this one is not so obvious, right? You may think of houseplants as an investment. And
some of them are (especially rare specimens). But you can easily find houseplants that cost
10 dollars, and we’re not talking about runts. Prices are going down as the popularity of
houseplants is going up, so even a trip to your local plant nursery won’t break the bank.
3. Houseplants are more environmentally friendly
Most people don’t realize the environmental footprint of the fresh flower industry. That’s
because we tend to associate flowers with nature, and nature can do no wrong, right?
What I Can Do
21
Well, not until it’s exploited for profit at a massive scale. Most cut flowers are grown year-round
in greenhouses and fields heavily laden with pesticides. In the United States, most fresh
flowersare imported. And because the flowers are already cut (so pretty much dead), they are
shipped long distances in refrigerated containers that take a lot of energy to stay cool.
There is also a lot of waste in the flower industry because we all want perfect-looking flowers
with zero blemishes. And not to mention the waste caused by the flowers being thrown away
en-masse if the supermarket can’t sell them within the short window when they look nice and
perky. We’re not saying that houseplants have a zero-carbon footprint. But they are definitely
the more responsible choice for eco-conscious Valentines.
4. Houseplants send a message
Now that we got the practical reasons out of the way, let’s talk a bit about the sentimental
symbolism. When you give someone a houseplant, the underlying message is this: I think
you’re a responsible person. I think you can nurture and take care of something. And you can
count on me because I’ll be around to help. Maybe in not so many words. But the sentiment
is there!
If your partner is already someone who loves houseplants, then offering them another plant
for their collection shows that you care about their interests and hobbies. And you get extra
bonus points for being a good listener if they’ve already hinted that they wouldn’t mind another
green friend, and you deliver.
