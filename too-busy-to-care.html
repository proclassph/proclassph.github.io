                                            hi guys I need your help.In England, traffic keeps on the left. Cars, buses and bikes all move on the left side of the road. But the traffic keeps on the right in China. So when you are in England, you must be very careful in the street. Before you cross a street you must stop and look both ways. Look right and look left and look right again. If the traffic lights are red, the traffic must stop. Then the people on foot can cross the road. If the traffic lights are green, the traffic can go. People on foot mustn't cross.In the morning and in the evening, when people go to or come back from work, the streets are very busy. Traffic is very dangerous When you go by bus in England, you have to be careful, too. Always remember that the traffic moves on the left. If you don't have a look first, you will go the wrong way.In many English cities, there are big buses with two floors. You can sit on the second floor. From there you can see the city very well. It's very interesting.​​</a>

                                            hi guys I need your help.In England, traffic keeps on the left. Cars, buses and bikes all move on the left side of the road. But the traffic keeps on the right in China. So when you are in England, you must be very careful in the street. Before you cross a street you must stop and look both ways. Look right and look left and look right again. If the traffic lights are red, the traffic must stop. Then the people on foot can cross the road. If the traffic lights are green, the traffic can go. People on foot mustn't cross.In the morning and in the evening, when people go to or come back from work, the streets are very busy. Traffic is very dangerous When you go by bus in England, you have to be careful, too. Always remember that the traffic moves on the left. If you don't have a look first, you will go the wrong way.In many English cities, there are big buses with two floors. You can sit on the second floor. From there you can see the city very well. It's very interesting.​​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>FAMILY PROBLEM ESSAY FOR YOU<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Family problems can take various forms, such as financial issues, conflicts among family members, and even major life changes like a divorce or a death in the family. Whatever the cause may be, it is essential to learn how to survive and cope with these problems effectively.</p><p></p><p>One way to deal with family problems is by improving communication within the family. Many times, problems arise due to misunderstandings or miscommunications between family members. By encouraging open and honest communication, family members can address issues and work together towards finding solutions. Family members should listen to each other without judgement and avoid interrupting or dismissing what others have to say.</p><p></p><p>Another way to survive family problems is by seeking outside help. Family counseling or therapy can provide a safe and neutral space for family members to express their thoughts and feelings, gain insights into the problem and work on finding solutions. Professional counseling can help family members understand each other better and teach them valuable coping skills to deal with difficult situations.</p><p></p><p>It is also important to practice empathy and compassion towards family members during tough times. Family members may be struggling with their own emotions and difficulties, and it is essential to acknowledge and support them. This can help build stronger bonds and a sense of unity within the family.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it is important to remember that family problems are normal and that every family experiences them at some point. It is essential to remain patient and to keep a positive attitude towards finding solutions. With time and effort, family members can work through their problems and come out stronger on the other side.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, family problems can be challenging, but they can also provide an opportunity for growth and learning. By improving communication, seeking outside help, practicing empathy and compassion, and remaining patient, family members can successfully survive and overcome difficult times.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Nagdaan ang nakakalula at makasaysayang panahon ng COVID-19, at bilang isang virtual assistant tulad ko, naging malaking bahagi ako ng pagkakaroon ng kaunting katiyakan at pag-asa sa kabilang bahagi ng computer screen para sa mga tao. Noong una, hindi namin alam kung paano paglalaruan ng virus ang aming buhay at pang-araw-araw na gawain, ngunit nagsama-sama kaming lahat at nagpasya na magtulungan para labanan ang pandemya.</p><p></p><p>Ang isa sa mga hamon na kailangan namin harapin ay ang pamamaraan ng edukasyon. Sa panahong ito ng paghihikahos at pagkabalisa, napilitan kaming magpatupad ng Modulang Pag-aaral sa Distansya. Ito ay naging napakahirap dahil hindi kami nakakapagkumpol bilang isang grupo upang magturo at mag-aral. Hindi rin namin maaring magtanong agad sa guro kapag may hindi namin naiintindihan, dahil hindi sila madaling maabot. Ngunit, dahil sa pagsisikap at pagtitiyaga sa pagsagot sa mga module, nakayanan naming makapasa sa mga aralin at makapagtapos ng pasukan.</p><p></p><p>Ang panahon ng pandemya ay hindi lamang tungkol sa paaralan at pag-aaral, ito rin ay tungkol sa pakikipaglaban sa pagkabagot. Dahil sa pangangailangan na manatili sa loob ng bahay, hindi na maaaring magawa ang mga aktibidad na dati ay nakakapagpasaya sa amin. Sa oras na ito, naisip naming magkakapatid na gumawa ng mga bagay na hindi namin pa nagagawa dati. Ito ay naging magandang pagkakataon upang malaman ang aming mga hilig, naging malapit kami sa isa't isa at nakapagbigay ng mga ideya sa aming mga magulang upang mapaligiran ng positibong enerhiya ang aming tahanan.</p><p></p><p>Kapag nagsama-sama ang magkakapatid, hindi maiiwasang magkaroon ng mga di pagkakaintindihan. Ngunit, ito ay hindi dapat maging sanhi upang mawala ang aming pagkakaisa at pagmamahalan bilang magkakapatid. Sa pagharap namin sa mga ganitong sitwasyon, kailangan naming makinig sa isa't isa at magbigay ng respeto at pagpapahalaga sa bawat isa. Sa pamamagitan ng pagkakaroon ng open communication at pag-unawa sa bawat isa, nakayanan naming malagpasan ang mga di pagkakaunawaan at manatiling malapit bilang magkakapatid.</p><p></p><p>Sa kabuuan, ang bawat isa sa mga hamong ito ay naging magandang oportunidad upang malaman ang mga bagay na mahalaga sa buhay. Sa pagsisikap, pagtitiyaga, pakikipagkaisa at pagmamahal sa pamilya, nakayanan naming malampasan ang mga ham</p><br />

                            29. hi guys I need your help.In England, traffic keeps on the left. Cars, buses and bikes all move on the left side of the road. But the traffic keeps on the right in China. So when you are in England, you must be very careful in the street. Before you cross a street you must stop and look both ways. Look right and look left and look right again. If the traffic lights are red, the traffic must stop. Then the people on foot can cross the road. If the traffic lights are green, the traffic can go. People on foot mustn't cross.In the morning and in the evening, when people go to or come back from work, the streets are very busy. Traffic is very dangerous When you go by bus in England, you have to be careful, too. Always remember that the traffic moves on the left. If you don't have a look first, you will go the wrong way.In many English cities, there are big buses with two floors. You can sit on the second floor. From there you can see the city very well. It's very interesting.​</h2><br />
