                                            In the previous module that you have accomplished, you have understood that every individual experiences certain stages of life that form his or her being a person.

                                            You were not able to prepare for your graded report in Oral Communication. Mr. Reyes, then calls you to go to the front and start your presentation. How are you going to explain your situation yo your teacher?    In this situation, the first thing I would do is to admit that I was not able to prepare for the presentation and explain why. After I finish explaining to Mr. Reyes the reason why I was unprepared, I would then gladly accept the mistake I made and face all the consequences that will come with it. Once I've come to terms with my mistake, I would then apologize to Mr. Reyes for the mishap I have caused. Then, I would ask him if I can redo, the presentation, and do anything to get the grade, if I were given the chance.Your cousin, Karl, calls you over the phone and tells you that he cannot help you in your errand because he needs to do something for his school project. What will you tell him to convince him to spare you a bit of his time and that you need him to buy the surprise birthday gift for your father?    I would politely ask Karl again if he can help me with my errand. I would tell him that I would help him with his school project after we finish the errand. I would also tell him that sparing a bit of his time is already a big help and that I'd appreciate it if he helps me. Once he agrees, I would also promise him that he can also call me when he needs help on another errand.You are about to start with your report which you have failed to prepare for when your mother calls you on your mobile phone. How are you going to respond to your mother? What will you tell her?    I would answer the call first to check with my mother if it was an urgent call. If she tells me that it wasn't urgent, then I would politely ask my mother to wait for me to call her back, as I am about to do a presentation. However, if the call was urgent, I would first ask my teacher if I can spare a few minutes for my mother. If the teacher does not approve, then I will just try to listen to her on speaker phone as I do my presentation.You are in the middle of your discussion about the Tree-Planting Initiative of your school but you noticed that the District Supervisor is not really paying attention to what you are saying. How will you address the Supervisor respectfully?    If I saw the supervisor was not listening to me, I would politely ask him for his opinion. This is a strategy to get his attention without disrespecting their authority.You are already on your way home when your best friend, Diego, approaches you and asks for your help with his graded report tomorrow. You know that you need to go home early because of the surprise birthday party for your father but you also see the concerned look on your best friend. What will you do and what are you going to tell Diego?    First, I would check up on the time to see if I have extra time before the party starts. If I have enough time, I would help Diego with his report. However, if there wasn't enough time before the party, I would ask Diego if I can just help him after the party. If he tells me that he's not available after the party, then I would help him find someone to help him with the project instead. I would've asked him to come over at the party, so that we can do it there, but I would not risk it since it would be disrespectful to my family.​</a>

How are you going to explain your situation yo your teacher?    In this situation, the first thing I would do is to admit that I was not able to prepare for the presentation and explain why. After I finish explaining to Mr. Reyes the reason why I was unprepared, I would then gladly accept the mistake I made and face all the consequences that will come with it.

I would politely ask Karl again if he can help me with my errand. I would tell him that I would help him with his school project after we finish the errand. I would also tell him that sparing a bit of his time is already a big help and that I'd appreciate it if he helps me. Once he agrees, I would also promise him that he can also call me when he needs help on another errand.You are about to start with your report which you have failed to prepare for when your mother calls you on your mobile phone.

If she tells me that it wasn't urgent, then I would politely ask my mother to wait for me to call her back, as I am about to do a presentation. However, if the call was urgent, I would first ask my teacher if I can spare a few minutes for my mother. If the teacher does not approve, then I will just try to listen to her on speaker phone as I do my presentation.You are in the middle of your discussion about the Tree-Planting Initiative of your school but you noticed that the District Supervisor is not really paying attention to what you are saying.

If I have enough time, I would help Diego with his report. However, if there wasn't enough time before the party, I would ask Diego if I can just help him after the party. If he tells me that he's not available after the party, then I would help him find someone to help him with the project instead. I would've asked him to come over at the party, so that we can do it there, but I would not risk it since it would be disrespectful to my family.​</h2><br />
