(2 points each) ABRAHAM’S COVENANT There was once a faithful man of God who worked hard and was blessed by God. Sadly, the one thing he did not have was a child. He longed for a son, and when the Lord promised to make him the father of many nations, Abram was happy and waited for his promised child. However, years went by and his wife Sarai still did not give him a son. In an attempt to take things into her own hands, Sarai convinced Abram to marry her maidservant Hagar, who was from Egypt. Abram did so, and Hagar became pregnant with a son. When the child was born, he was called Ishmael. This was not the child of promise, for the Lord promised that a son would be born to Sarai, and that He would bless Abram through him. One day, three men visited Abram, who showed them great hospitality. These men were actually God and His angels who came in disguise. They told Abram that by the same time next year, Sarai would have a son. Sarai laughed, as she thought she was much too old to have a child. The Lord also gave Abram and Sarai new names, and from then they were known as Abraham and Sarah, for Sarah means “Princess”, and she would be the mother of many nations. What would you do if you were in Abram’s position?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Music of Poland covers diverse aspects of music and musical traditions which have originated, and are practiced in Poland. Artists from Poland include world-famous classical composers like Frédéric Chopin, Karol Szymanowski, Witold Lutosławski, Henryk Górecki and Krzysztof Penderecki; renowned pianists like Arthur Rubinstein, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, and Krystian Zimerman; as well as popular music artists, and traditional, regionalised folk music ensembles that create a rich and lively music scene at the grassroots level. The musicians of Poland, over the course of history, have developed and popularized a variety of music genres and folk dances such as mazurka, polonaise, krakowiak, kujawiak, polska partner dance, oberek; as well as the sung poetry genre (poezja śpiewana) and others. Mazurka (Mazur), Krakowiak, Kujawiak, Oberek and Polonaise (Polonez) are registered as Polish National Dances, originating in early Middle Ages. The oldest of them is Polonaise that comes from the Medieval pageant dances and it was originally called "chodzony", a "walking dance".</p><br />

However, it lacks coherence and organization as it jumps between different ideas and examples without any clear structure. The paragraph would benefit from a clear introduction, body, and conclusion that present a well-organized argument about the significance of teachers in society.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the paragraph could use some editing to correct grammar and spelling errors, as well as to clarify some of the ideas presented. For example, the sentence "If there had not been teachers there would have not been any doctor, engineer, scientists, t a teacher is not a king but teachers king" is unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while the paragraph expresses admiration for teachers, it lacks a clear structure and would benefit from some editing and revision.</p><p></p><br />

                            29. Read and answer the following questions in sentence form. (2 points each) ABRAHAM’S COVENANT There was once a faithful man of God who worked hard and was blessed by God. Sadly, the one thing he did not have was a child. He longed for a son, and when the Lord promised to make him the father of many nations, Abram was happy and waited for his promised child. However, years went by and his wife Sarai still did not give him a son. In an attempt to take things into her own hands, Sarai convinced Abram to marry her maidservant Hagar, who was from Egypt. Abram did so, and Hagar became pregnant with a son. When the child was born, he was called Ishmael. This was not the child of promise, for the Lord promised that a son would be born to Sarai, and that He would bless Abram through him. One day, three men visited Abram, who showed them great hospitality. These men were actually God and His angels who came in disguise. They told Abram that by the same time next year, Sarai would have a son. Sarai laughed, as she thought she was much too old to have a child. The Lord also gave Abram and Sarai new names, and from then they were known as Abraham and Sarah, for Sarah means “Princess”, and she would be the mother of many nations. What would you do if you were in Abram’s position?​</h2><br />
                        "What would you do if you were in Abram's position?"<p><strong>If I were in Abram's position, I would continue to have faith in God's promises and trust that He would fulfill them in His own time. I would not take matters into my own hands or try to make things happen through my own efforts, instead, I would wait patiently and continue to serve and obey God.</strong></p><br />
