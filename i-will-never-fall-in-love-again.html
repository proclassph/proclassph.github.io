                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                                            Motorboat Miracle Motorboats have always thrilled me. I love to read about them and dream about them, don't you? But here is a motorboat story that is quite different. I am sure you have never read anything like it before. Yet it is absolutely true, It happened during the war in the South Pacific. The motorboat, a fine launch, was taken over by the military soon after war was declared. Emissionary and a motorboat miracle. Naturally, the white man in charge was sorry to give it up, but there was nothing else to do. The enemy was drawing nearer every week. The natives were sorry, too, for they knew this boat well, and to them it was a messenger of light. Some time later, when the Allied Forces had to leave these islands, the military decided to destroy the launch in order to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. So, they sent someone to pour petrol over the little vessel and set a match to it. There was a sudden explosion and a spurt of flame. But a sharp gust of wind blew out the flames, and the boat, though slightly charred, was left unharmed. Soon the white people had all gone and only the natives were left. They decided that they would try to save the launch. So they towed it away and hid it far up a little creek. Then, they planted bushes on its deck, and fast-growing vines, so that it could not be seen by enemy planes. Then, to make absolutely sure that the boat would be of no use to the enemies should they discover its hiding place, the natives decided to remove the engine and scatter the parts all over the island. With wrench and spanner and screwdriver they took that motor apart. They had changed it into a pile of nuts, bolts, screws, rings, pistons, spark plugs, and all the rest. Then came the task of hiding these parts, so that the enemy could not possibly find them. But it should be in such a way that they could be easily gathered together again. Some of the larger parts, they buried in the sand. The crankshaft was tied to the branch of a tall tree. As for the nuts, bolts, washers, and little things like that, they were carefully tied together, a few at a time, and hung around the necks of the natives. They guessed that the Japanese would presume that they were just wearing charms. They guessed right. And they wore those "charms" round their necks until the war ended. No enemy spy once suspected what they really were. At last the tide of war turned. The Japanese fled, and the Allies came back. Shortly after that the missionary himself returned. When the natives saw him, they greeted him with great joy. Then, they asked him if he would like to see the launch.how do i summarize this in each paragraph?​</a>

Wherefore art thou Romeo?Deny thy father and refuse thy name;Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,And I'll no longer be a Capulet.ROMEO: (Aside) Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?JULIET: 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy,Thou art thyself though not a Montague.What's Montague?

Back to the Future
 Heath had come clean. The way of life he had led until now couldn't satisfy him.
The day he decided to mend his mistakes was the day his mother said she still loved him.
Heath knew, no doubt, that his family was waiting for him to turn around. Even in the darkest
hours of the disappearance, Heath had not lost his faith in his family. Then, he had lost faith
in himself and had walked out in anger. Heath had become lonely for the love that he had
found smothering. After nights on the footpath, Heath knew what it took for his father to put a
roof over his head. Suddenly, it all made sense. Heath was himself again. He felt newer and
surer of himself like never before.
Passage 2
Not Drowning, but Waving
The day I almost drowned had saved my life.
I saw the world inside the waters' sphere.
Submerged I thought that I had lost it all,
and things had ended after one fateful fall.
But then, two hands reached for my shaky limbs.
I was pulled up; I made it to the shore.
I thank my life, more than I thanked before. 1. How are the archetypal settings in the poem and the story alike?

                                            .  The Abandoned House An Hoang Grade 6 Short Story 2015I looked nostalgically at the old abandoned house that was standing there gloomily. The house used to be alive and cheerful but it was now forgotten and had an air of melancholy. Cobwebs littered the house, with the wooden roof and walls falling in. Sunlight no longer danced through the windows and sounds of laughter were no longer heard; all that was left was the remains of a long since dead house. The lights stared downwards miserably at a table that would never serve anyone ever again, with chairs that had not been warm in many years. Dust blew past the dark hallways, a sad reminder that this house would never be whole again.The house was not always dead. I can forlornly recall all of my visits to this once beautiful house. Every summer holiday, my parents had brought me to this house, my grandparents' house. I had lived in the city, so the experience of living in a rural area was very different and yet it was so much fun. The bright sunshine, the gentle wind and the quietness that had been introduced to me in that wonderful house had all come to be things that I loved. After the first visit, I was always enthusiastically waiting to visit what had become my second home. I remember being so eager to help out, trying to help in any way I could, like attempting to help paint the house with grandpa, handing the right bolts and nails for fixing the fence or collecting the eggs from the hens with grandma. I had almost always messed up everything I tried to do but my grandparents had kindly taught me again how to do it properly. The house that my grandparents once lived in had so many good memories of my fun and carefree childhood that I knew that I would have to visit it again one day. After waiting patiently for ten years, I had went to the address that I used to happily go to every year. At first, I thought I had gone to the wrong house and yet, after going back and forth, I had come to the horrible realisation that the destroyed, abandoned house I was looking at was the right house. I could not believe my eyes as I mentally recounted how the now ruined house used to be when I was but a young child.The house was always bright and had young, hyperactive children (including me) running around, playing tag. The house was extensively cared for as my obsessive compulsive grandmother and my effervescent grandfather treated like an additional child. Flowers of all colours filled the elegant garden, brightening the entire area. In that one simple house, birthdays had been celebrated, laughs were shared and fireworks were watched. The house was the epitome of liveliness and yet it was now dead. It was now merely a shadow of its former glory, for the house was no longer alive, and never would be again.find the 10 adverbs in this story​</a>

But it was so muchwork grinding the rice with the pestles and mortaen. So she poured all their rice forthe day into a very large mortar and tool up a very large peste to grind it with.

So she hung her largerpieces of jewelry upon the sky, which were her silver comb, her gold ring, and her longpearl necdoce.

                            4. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                            5. Motorboat Miracle Motorboats have always thrilled me. I love to read about them and dream about them, don't you? But here is a motorboat story that is quite different. I am sure you have never read anything like it before. Yet it is absolutely true, It happened during the war in the South Pacific. The motorboat, a fine launch, was taken over by the military soon after war was declared. Emissionary and a motorboat miracle. Naturally, the white man in charge was sorry to give it up, but there was nothing else to do. The enemy was drawing nearer every week. The natives were sorry, too, for they knew this boat well, and to them it was a messenger of light. Some time later, when the Allied Forces had to leave these islands, the military decided to destroy the launch in order to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. So, they sent someone to pour petrol over the little vessel and set a match to it. There was a sudden explosion and a spurt of flame. But a sharp gust of wind blew out the flames, and the boat, though slightly charred, was left unharmed. Soon the white people had all gone and only the natives were left. They decided that they would try to save the launch. So they towed it away and hid it far up a little creek. Then, they planted bushes on its deck, and fast-growing vines, so that it could not be seen by enemy planes. Then, to make absolutely sure that the boat would be of no use to the enemies should they discover its hiding place, the natives decided to remove the engine and scatter the parts all over the island. With wrench and spanner and screwdriver they took that motor apart. They had changed it into a pile of nuts, bolts, screws, rings, pistons, spark plugs, and all the rest. Then came the task of hiding these parts, so that the enemy could not possibly find them. But it should be in such a way that they could be easily gathered together again. Some of the larger parts, they buried in the sand. The crankshaft was tied to the branch of a tall tree. As for the nuts, bolts, washers, and little things like that, they were carefully tied together, a few at a time, and hung around the necks of the natives. They guessed that the Japanese would presume that they were just wearing charms. They guessed right. And they wore those "charms" round their necks until the war ended. No enemy spy once suspected what they really were. At last the tide of war turned. The Japanese fled, and the Allies came back. Shortly after that the missionary himself returned. When the natives saw him, they greeted him with great joy. Then, they asked him if he would like to see the launch.how do i summarize this in each paragraph?​</h2><br />

                            8. ROMEO: He jests at scars that never felt a wound.(Juliet appears above at the window)But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks?It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,Who is already sick and pale with grief,That thou her maid art far more fair than she:Be not her maid, since she is envious;Her vestal livery is but sick and greenAnd none but fools do wear it; cast it off.It is my lady, O, it is my love!O, that she knew she were!She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks;Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,Having some business, do entreat her eyesTo twinkle in their spheres till they retum.What if her eyes were there, they in her head?The brightness of her check would shame those stars,As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heavenWould through the airy region stream so bightThat birds would sing and think it were not night.See, how she leans her cheecks upon her handO, that I were a glove upon that hand,That I might touch that cheek!JULIET: Ay me!ROMEO: She speaks:O, speak again, bright angel! For thou artAs glorious to this night, being o'er my headAs is a winged messenger of heavenUnto the white-upturned wondering eyesOf mortals that fall back to gaze on himWhen he bestrides the lazy-pacing cloudsAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.JULIET: O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?Deny thy father and refuse thy name;Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,And I'll no longer be a Capulet.ROMEO: (Aside) Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?JULIET: 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy,Thou art thyself though not a Montague.What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,Nor arm, nor face, nor any other partBelonging to a man. O, be some other name!What's in a name? that which we call a roseBy any other name would smell as sweet;So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'dRetain that dear perfection which he owesWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,And for that name which is no part of theeTake all myself.ROMEO: I take thee at thy word:Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;Henceforth I never will be Romeo.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Setting —The play is set in the thirteenth or fourteenth century in Italy in Verona and Mantua. Much of the action takes place in Juliet's house. Two cities of Venice are also mentioned in the play. ... The play's basic setting, therefore, is rich and elegant.Theme — Love is naturally the play's dominant and most important theme. The play focuses on romantic love, specifically the intense passion that springs up at first sight between Romeo and Juliet. In Romeo and Juliet, love is a violent, ecstatic, overpowering force that supersedes all other values, loyalties, and emotions.Conflict — There are a few central conflicts in the play Romeo and Juliet. A major conflict throughout the whole play is the fighting between the Montagues and the Capulets. They are in a bitter feud, and everyone in Verona, Italy is affected by their hate for each other.<p></p>pakibrainliest <br />

                            9. Passage 1
Back to the Future
 Heath had come clean. The way of life he had led until now couldn't satisfy him.
The day he decided to mend his mistakes was the day his mother said she still loved him.
Heath knew, no doubt, that his family was waiting for him to turn around. Even in the darkest
hours of the disappearance, Heath had not lost his faith in his family. Then, he had lost faith
in himself and had walked out in anger. Heath had become lonely for the love that he had
found smothering. After nights on the footpath, Heath knew what it took for his father to put a
roof over his head. Suddenly, it all made sense. Heath was himself again. He felt newer and
surer of himself like never before.
Passage 2
Not Drowning, but Waving
The day I almost drowned had saved my life.
I saw the world inside the waters' sphere.
Submerged I thought that I had lost it all,
and things had ended after one fateful fall.
But then, two hands reached for my shaky limbs.
I was pulled up; I made it to the shore.
I thank my life, more than I thanked before. 1. How are the archetypal settings in the poem and the story alike?

                            10. .  The Abandoned House An Hoang Grade 6 Short Story 2015I looked nostalgically at the old abandoned house that was standing there gloomily. The house used to be alive and cheerful but it was now forgotten and had an air of melancholy. Cobwebs littered the house, with the wooden roof and walls falling in. Sunlight no longer danced through the windows and sounds of laughter were no longer heard; all that was left was the remains of a long since dead house. The lights stared downwards miserably at a table that would never serve anyone ever again, with chairs that had not been warm in many years. Dust blew past the dark hallways, a sad reminder that this house would never be whole again.The house was not always dead. I can forlornly recall all of my visits to this once beautiful house. Every summer holiday, my parents had brought me to this house, my grandparents' house. I had lived in the city, so the experience of living in a rural area was very different and yet it was so much fun. The bright sunshine, the gentle wind and the quietness that had been introduced to me in that wonderful house had all come to be things that I loved. After the first visit, I was always enthusiastically waiting to visit what had become my second home. I remember being so eager to help out, trying to help in any way I could, like attempting to help paint the house with grandpa, handing the right bolts and nails for fixing the fence or collecting the eggs from the hens with grandma. I had almost always messed up everything I tried to do but my grandparents had kindly taught me again how to do it properly. The house that my grandparents once lived in had so many good memories of my fun and carefree childhood that I knew that I would have to visit it again one day. After waiting patiently for ten years, I had went to the address that I used to happily go to every year. At first, I thought I had gone to the wrong house and yet, after going back and forth, I had come to the horrible realisation that the destroyed, abandoned house I was looking at was the right house. I could not believe my eyes as I mentally recounted how the now ruined house used to be when I was but a young child.The house was always bright and had young, hyperactive children (including me) running around, playing tag. The house was extensively cared for as my obsessive compulsive grandmother and my effervescent grandfather treated like an additional child. Flowers of all colours filled the elegant garden, brightening the entire area. In that one simple house, birthdays had been celebrated, laughs were shared and fireworks were watched. The house was the epitome of liveliness and yet it was now dead. It was now merely a shadow of its former glory, for the house was no longer alive, and never would be again.find the 10 adverbs in this story​</h2><br />

But it was so muchwork grinding the rice with the pestles and mortaen. So she poured all their rice forthe day into a very large mortar and tool up a very large peste to grind it with. Thepeste was so all that when it hit the mortar, it touched the sly. The first woman wasoblivious to this the only low she had to grind all the rice before her husband camehome for supper. She will wore at her jewelry. She noticed that her jewelry kept fallingoff or bumpered her in any other way whenever she worked. So she hung her largerpieces of jewelry upon the sky, which were her silver comb, her gold ring, and her longpearl necdoce. And then she went to work with the huge peorie, unknowing that asone end of the poste pounded onto the rice grains, the other end was pounding ontothe sly.

She was astonished to see that the sley had risen so high- and taken hermost precious things with it she could see her silver corab shiring where the moon isnow, and the bends of her lovely accldace twinkling all around it.
