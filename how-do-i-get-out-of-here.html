                                            THE GOAT AND THE FOXOnce a fox was roaming around in the dark. Unfortunately, he fell into a well. He tried his level best to come out but all in vain. So, he had no other alternative but to remain there until the next morning. The next day, a goat came that way. She peeped into the well and saw the fox there. The goat asked, “what are you doing there, Mr. Fox?” The sly fox replied, “I came here to drink water. It is the best I have ever tasted. Come and see for yourself.” Without thinking even for a while, the goat jumped into the well, quenched her thirst and looked for a way to get out. But just like the fox, she also found herself helpless to come out. Then the fox said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. I’ll climb on your head and get out. Then I shall help you come out too.” The goat was innocent enough to understand the shrewdness of the fox and did as the fox said and helped him get out of the well. While walking away, the fox said, “Had you been intelligent enough, you would never have got in without seeing how to get out.” Describe the moral behavior of the fox Is the character's action pleasing or displeasing? What should the character have done or have not done? What life lesson have you learned from the character? From the story itself? In what situations can you apply the moral of the story?

                                            THE FOX IN THE WELLOne day a fox fell into a well. He jumped and jumped but he could not get out. The well was toodeep. Soon he began to feel cold and hungry.Suddenly there was a noise from above. A goat had come to drink from the well. It looked in and sawthe fox, "Why, what are you doing down there, Mr. Fox?" asked the goat.The fox was very cunning. Quickly, he thought of a way to trick the goat. "Oh, I'm drinking," he said."Down there? But there's water in the bucket up here.""Yes, I know," said the fox. "But the water down here is much sweeter.Why don't you come down and taste it for yourself?""I think I will do that." And the silly animal jumped into the well.At once the fox leapt on to the goat's back. And from there he soon jumped out of the well."Hey! Where are you going?" cried the goat. "What about me? How am I going to get out of here?""Ah-ha, you silly goat," laughed the fox. "Don't you think you should have thought of that before youjumped in?"And still laughing to himself he ran off, leaving the poor goat in the well.Basing from the story read, answer the following questions.1. Who is the main character of the story?2. Who was trapped in the well?3. Who came passing and thirsty?4. What convinced the goat to go down the well?5. How did the fox get out of the well?6.

I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd
Need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were
Yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with me
Yeah
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay

My Life is in Your Hands (From a client's perspective)
by: Stephanie Griffey
I did not choose this life or these struggles that I face
And I don’t know how I got here to such a vulnerable state.
Everyone is quick to judge me yet they offer no help.
Can’t they see I’m alone here? I’m doing this by myself.
Maybe I’ve made some mistakes but I did not ask for this.
I don’t know how to get out now. These walls are caving in.
The world seems so big and the possibilities so small.
There’s no room to breathe here, no one to catch my fall.
So here I stand, no way to cope.
I’ve come to you, my last source of hope.
Please tell me you have an answer to end the hunger and the pain.
Tell me you can help me to finally live again.
Is there light at the horizon; are there brighter days for me?
I stand at your mercy; do you hear this humble plea?
Can you feed my children and give them care?
Can you give me direction in this world out there?
Can you save me from myself and heal me inside?
Can you explain this hopelessness I feel inside?
Can you take away this anger; can you throw away this rage?
Can you really show me love? Can you erase this hate?
Can you explain to me why my body is so frail?
How did I get here in an empty sail?
Why did he hurt me? The answers are unknown.
He took away my innocence. He invaded my soul.
I want to live. I don’t want to cry.
But I’ve lost the battle for inside I’ve died.
I may not be here by choice but it isn’t by chance;
that you’ve crossed my path and seen my circumstance.
I’ve tried everything else there’s nothing more I can do.
I’ve made the first step. The rest is up to you.
So here I am. Fix me if you can.
I give it to you; my life is in your hands.

"GoodIt is the best water I ever tasted in my whole life," answered the fox, drinking a gulp of water. Without a second thought, the goat jumped in. After drinking some water, he looked about for a way to get out of the well. "How do we get out of here?" he asked the fox? "I know what we can do," said the fox. Looking at the goat from the corner of his eye. "Stand on your hind legs. Plant your fore legs firmly against the side of the well. I'll climb on your back, and I'll step on your horns. Then I can get out. When I'm out, I'll help you get out too." "That's a good idea!" said the goat happily as he did what the fox told him to do. The fox climbed on the goat's back and horns. Then he jumped out of the well and started on his way. "Hey!" shouted the goat. “Help me out of here. You promised to help me.” "You silly goat,” said the fox.

I can't stop sliding down. There is no way to stop! I'm sliding to five small round bumps! Bap, bop, bop, bop, boplOuch! That hurt. And now I'm hungry. I will need a snack. Yes, here comes a yummy burger sliding to my back!Hooray! It's in my hands. Oh wait... the friction isn't near. The burger's slipping off my hands, It's sliding out of here!I'm sliding like the floors were ice; I cannot stop at all! Oh no! Now I am heading right into a red brick wall!Now, how do you get out of this imaginary world? Just stop imagining! And "POOF!" into my seat I'm hurled.Phee-ew!

                            5. THE GOAT AND THE FOXOnce a fox was roaming around in the dark. Unfortunately, he fell into a well. He tried his level best to come out but all in vain. So, he had no other alternative but to remain there until the next morning. The next day, a goat came that way. She peeped into the well and saw the fox there. The goat asked, “what are you doing there, Mr. Fox?” The sly fox replied, “I came here to drink water. It is the best I have ever tasted. Come and see for yourself.” Without thinking even for a while, the goat jumped into the well, quenched her thirst and looked for a way to get out. But just like the fox, she also found herself helpless to come out. Then the fox said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. I’ll climb on your head and get out. Then I shall help you come out too.” The goat was innocent enough to understand the shrewdness of the fox and did as the fox said and helped him get out of the well. While walking away, the fox said, “Had you been intelligent enough, you would never have got in without seeing how to get out.” Describe the moral behavior of the fox Is the character's action pleasing or displeasing? What should the character have done or have not done? What life lesson have you learned from the character? From the story itself? In what situations can you apply the moral of the story? Cite examples.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The fox in the story displays cunning and deception by tricking an innocent goat into jumping into a well. The fox's dishonest actions are reprehensible as he takes advantage of the goat's trust and lack of foresight to use her as a stepping stone to escape. The fox's behavior is unacceptable as he puts the goat's safety and well-being at risk without any consideration. The lesson learned from this story is to be cautious and think carefully before trusting others, especially those who have a history of deceit and manipulation. It also emphasizes the importance of intelligence and knowledge in avoiding dangerous situations and making wise decisions. This moral can be applied in various situations, such as in business dealings and personal relationships. It is crucial to be aware of red flags that may indicate that someone is not trustworthy and to thoroughly research and verify any deals or offers. Blindly trusting someone without caution may result in negative consequences.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>you can organize it</p><strong>A</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>W</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><p></p><p>1.) The moral behavior of the fox in the story is deceitful and cunning.

The life lesson from this story is that one should always be cautious and not trust blindly.

The moral of the story can be applied in various situations where we should be careful and not fall for deceitful tactics.

"Oh, I'm drinking," he said."Down there? But there's water in the bucket up here.""Yes, I know," said the fox. "But the water down here is much sweeter.Why don't you come down and taste it for yourself?""I think I will do that." And the silly animal jumped into the well.At once the fox leapt on to the goat's back. And from there he soon jumped out of the well."Hey! Where are you going?" cried the goat. "What about me? How am I going to get out of here?""Ah-ha, you silly goat," laughed the fox. "Don't you think you should have thought of that before youjumped in?"And still laughing to himself he ran off, leaving the poor goat in the well.Basing from the story read, answer the following questions.1.

Need you there when I cry

And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side

I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone

When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

Do you see how much I need you right now?

And make it okay
I miss you
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were
Yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with me
Yeah

My Life is in Your Hands (From a client's perspective)
by: Stephanie Griffey
I did not choose this life or these struggles that I face
And I don’t know how I got here to such a vulnerable state.
Everyone is quick to judge me yet they offer no help.
Can’t they see I’m alone here? I’m doing this by myself.
Maybe I’ve made some mistakes but I did not ask for this.
I don’t know how to get out now. These walls are caving in.
The world seems so big and the possibilities so small.
There’s no room to breathe here, no one to catch my fall.
So here I stand, no way to cope.
I’ve come to you, my last source of hope.
Please tell me you have an answer to end the hunger and the pain.
Tell me you can help me to finally live again.
Is there light at the horizon; are there brighter days for me?
I stand at your mercy; do you hear this humble plea?
Can you feed my children and give them care?
Can you give me direction in this world out there?
Can you save me from myself and heal me inside?
Can you explain this hopelessness I feel inside?
Can you take away this anger; can you throw away this rage?
Can you really show me love? Can you erase this hate?
Can you explain to me why my body is so frail?
How did I get here in an empty sail?
Why did he hurt me? The answers are unknown.
He took away my innocence. He invaded my soul.
I want to live. I don’t want to cry.
But I’ve lost the battle for inside I’ve died.
I may not be here by choice but it isn’t by chance;
that you’ve crossed my path and seen my circumstance.
I’ve tried everything else there’s nothing more I can do.
I’ve made the first step. The rest is up to you.
So here I am. Fix me if you can.
I give it to you; my life is in your hands.

Looking into the well, he saw the fox. “Hello," he called. "What are you doing down there? "Drinking some water of course!" replied the fox. "Is it good?" asked the goat. "GoodIt is the best water I ever tasted in my whole life," answered the fox, drinking a gulp of water. Without a second thought, the goat jumped in. After drinking some water, he looked about for a way to get out of the well. "How do we get out of here?" he asked the fox? "I know what we can do," said the fox. Looking at the goat from the corner of his eye. "Stand on your hind legs. Plant your fore legs firmly against the side of the well. I'll climb on your back, and I'll step on your horns. Then I can get out. When I'm out, I'll help you get out too." "That's a good idea!" said the goat happily as he did what the fox told him to do. The fox climbed on the goat's back and horns. Then he jumped out of the well and started on his way. "Hey!" shouted the goat. “Help me out of here. You promised to help me.” "You silly goat,” said the fox.

I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd
Need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were
Yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with me
Yeah
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
