                                            GRADE 9 READING ACTIVITY WEEK 2 CALLIOPE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY: MUSE OF ELOQUENCE &amp; EPIC POETRY Greek mythology was filled with gods and spirits who influenced events and people living on earth. Among these supernatural beings were nine sisters called Mousai, or Muses. The Muses were daughters of the chief Greek god Zeus and his 'aunt,' the Titan Mnemosyne. Mnemosyne was the Titan responsible for memory - one of the most important intellectual gifts possessed by humans. According to myth, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights in a row. Each night she conceived a new Muse and Calliope was the firstborn daughter. The Muses' main power was to inspire humans in writing, music, and the arts. Calliope is the Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry. She is also the Muse of music, song, and dance. Her name, also spelled 'Kalliope,' means 'beautiful-voiced' in Ancient Greek. She bears no relation to another Calliope in Greek mythology who was a daughter of the river god Nestus. Most of what we know about Calliope comes from the writer Hesiod and his great work the Theogony which was written between 750 and 650 BC. Later writers, including Ovid and Virgil, also included her in their stories. Little is known about her early life, but she is frequently pictured as a beautiful young woman holding a writing tablet or scroll. She and her sisters were tutored in the arts by none other than Apollo - the patron god of music and poetry. Calliope rarely appears alone in Greek myths and is usually seen working with her sisters toward some end. Calliope and the other Muses frequented Mount Helicon where humans often worshiped them and asked for their assistance. Most of the time, however, the Muses lived on Mount Olympus where they attended to Zeus and the other major Greek gods. As with many ancient myths, there are varying descriptions of Calliope's relationships and family life. She is commonly represented as the mother of two famous sons - Linus and Orpheus. The boys' father is given as Apollo or Oeagrus, King of Thrace. Linus became a famous musician who was the first to pair singing with the playing of the harp. Calliope's other son Orpheus led a tragic life. He was blessed with incredible musical talents. His mother taught him to sing and play and Apollo gave him a golden lyre as a gift. His skills were so amazing that creatures, trees, and even stones would follow him to listen to his music. In time, Orpheus travelled to the underworld to rescue his wife Eurydice from death. His music warmed the cold hearts of Hades and Persephone who allowed him to leave with his wife. Unfortunately, his failure to heed their directions resulted in her return to the underworld and his everlasting grief. Questions: 1. The name Calliope means __________. 2. How many sisters does she have? 3. Calliope was pictured as a beautiful young woman that is holding ______. 4. Why Calliope and the other muses frequented at Mount Helicon? 5. Why do they sometimes go to Mount Olympus?​</a>

                                            HUMAN STORY "The Woman with a Big Heart" In the early 1900s, Agnes was born to a family of five children. Her parents were very religious. What united them was their love for God and for one another. Agnes grew up to be a happy person, always with a warm smile that brightened anyone she had met. When she was ten, her father died and her mother had to work harder to feed them and to send them to school. When Agnes was fifteen, some Yugoslav priests set out for the missions in India. One of the priests would regularly write her about the sick, orphans, and the neglected in India. Agnes would be so absorbed in his stories that she began to think of becoming a nun so she could devote her life for others, like her priest friend. The thought and desire of becoming one kept coming to her mind. Agnes prayed for a long time until she was sure of what God was asking of her to do. She believed He was calling her to give her life totally to Him and others. At first, she joined the Sisters of Loreto. There, she learned strict discipline, spent hours of praying, and devoted her time teaching children. Later, however, she felt she was being called by God to do something more, that is, to live her life among the poor in India, especially the sick and the dying. Without money or means but only with a great desire to reach out because of love, she went out to the streets of Calcutta and uplifted people left to die by the road. She took care of babies abandoned on heaps of garbage and reached out to lepers whose decaying bodies were feasted upon by rats. Eventually, help both material and human resources came from compassionate people. Many joined her in her mission to love and care for the abandoned. They became known as the Missionaries of Charity. Today she is lovingly remembered as Saint Teresa of Calcutta: the woman with a big heart ACTIVITY 2. QUESTION FOR DISCUSSION 1. Did the story of Saint Teresa of Calcutta inspire you? Why? 2. What does her story tell us about our Christian mission in the world where many are suffering?​</a>

                            6. GRADE 9 READING ACTIVITY WEEK 2 CALLIOPE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY: MUSE OF ELOQUENCE &amp; EPIC POETRY Greek mythology was filled with gods and spirits who influenced events and people living on earth. Among these supernatural beings were nine sisters called Mousai, or Muses. The Muses were daughters of the chief Greek god Zeus and his 'aunt,' the Titan Mnemosyne. Mnemosyne was the Titan responsible for memory - one of the most important intellectual gifts possessed by humans. According to myth, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne for nine nights in a row. Each night she conceived a new Muse and Calliope was the firstborn daughter. The Muses' main power was to inspire humans in writing, music, and the arts. Calliope is the Muse of Eloquence and Epic Poetry. She is also the Muse of music, song, and dance. Her name, also spelled 'Kalliope,' means 'beautiful-voiced' in Ancient Greek. She bears no relation to another Calliope in Greek mythology who was a daughter of the river god Nestus. Most of what we know about Calliope comes from the writer Hesiod and his great work the Theogony which was written between 750 and 650 BC. Later writers, including Ovid and Virgil, also included her in their stories. Little is known about her early life, but she is frequently pictured as a beautiful young woman holding a writing tablet or scroll. She and her sisters were tutored in the arts by none other than Apollo - the patron god of music and poetry. Calliope rarely appears alone in Greek myths and is usually seen working with her sisters toward some end. Calliope and the other Muses frequented Mount Helicon where humans often worshiped them and asked for their assistance. Most of the time, however, the Muses lived on Mount Olympus where they attended to Zeus and the other major Greek gods. As with many ancient myths, there are varying descriptions of Calliope's relationships and family life. She is commonly represented as the mother of two famous sons - Linus and Orpheus. The boys' father is given as Apollo or Oeagrus, King of Thrace. Linus became a famous musician who was the first to pair singing with the playing of the harp. Calliope's other son Orpheus led a tragic life. He was blessed with incredible musical talents. His mother taught him to sing and play and Apollo gave him a golden lyre as a gift. His skills were so amazing that creatures, trees, and even stones would follow him to listen to his music. In time, Orpheus travelled to the underworld to rescue his wife Eurydice from death. His music warmed the cold hearts of Hades and Persephone who allowed him to leave with his wife. Unfortunately, his failure to heed their directions resulted in her return to the underworld and his everlasting grief. Questions: 1. The name Calliope means __________. 2.

                            11. HUMAN STORY "The Woman with a Big Heart" In the early 1900s, Agnes was born to a family of five children. Her parents were very religious. What united them was their love for God and for one another. Agnes grew up to be a happy person, always with a warm smile that brightened anyone she had met. When she was ten, her father died and her mother had to work harder to feed them and to send them to school. When Agnes was fifteen, some Yugoslav priests set out for the missions in India. One of the priests would regularly write her about the sick, orphans, and the neglected in India. Agnes would be so absorbed in his stories that she began to think of becoming a nun so she could devote her life for others, like her priest friend. The thought and desire of becoming one kept coming to her mind. Agnes prayed for a long time until she was sure of what God was asking of her to do. She believed He was calling her to give her life totally to Him and others. At first, she joined the Sisters of Loreto. There, she learned strict discipline, spent hours of praying, and devoted her time teaching children. Later, however, she felt she was being called by God to do something more, that is, to live her life among the poor in India, especially the sick and the dying. Without money or means but only with a great desire to reach out because of love, she went out to the streets of Calcutta and uplifted people left to die by the road. She took care of babies abandoned on heaps of garbage and reached out to lepers whose decaying bodies were feasted upon by rats. Eventually, help both material and human resources came from compassionate people. Many joined her in her mission to love and care for the abandoned. They became known as the Missionaries of Charity. Today she is lovingly remembered as Saint Teresa of Calcutta: the woman with a big heart ACTIVITY 2. QUESTION FOR DISCUSSION 1. Did the story of Saint Teresa of Calcutta inspire you? Why? 2. What does her story tell us about our Christian mission in the world where many are suffering?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Bible states that homosexuality is a sin because it goes against God's plan for human sexuality.

In Romans 1:26-27, Paul writes that homosexual behavior is unnatural and shameful.</p><br />
