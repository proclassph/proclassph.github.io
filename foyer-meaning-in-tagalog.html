But it should help. It should help that, as a hero, his life and deed are engraved in textbooks, relived in skits and songs, and taught in school. We need only to recall again the letter Jesus Luis de Leon- Borbon wrote here last month to see how vital- no, how desperate- this undertaking is. De Leon, a half-Spaniard, was looking at the statue of Isidro Torres in Malolos when a group of kids came over and began wondering ho Torres was. Surprised, De Leon volunteered that Torres was a hero who fought by the side of Gregorio del Pillar. “This del Pilar” said one of the kids, “ is he also one of the heroes?”Conrado de Quiros, “Hero Worship” in There’s the Rub, Philippine Daily Inquiry( August 20, 1993)	Topic Sentence: __________________________________________________3.When she was teaching, she would relish the weekends for the endless tasks which she found to be done in her home. Clothes sorted, darned, set aside for renovation, and she, in close company with the sewing woman whom she hired for the day. The closets had to e cleared, the plants to be inspected, the unhealthy and the dying to be made well again, the lush and the flowering to be enjoyed. The kitchen to be given the week’s checkup, marketing, children and husband to be fussed over, enjoyed.Lina Espina- Moore, “The Mansion” in A Lion in the House(1980)Topic Sentence: __________________________________________________​</a>

                                            1. Topic Sentence:
After driving through a stretch of eerie darkness, the mansion at the end of the winding driveway
is an illuminating sight. Lights spotlight the colonial façade and the brick walk leading to an open patio
that fans out into the front door. A leaning tree shelters the edge of the patio. On the right side of the wide
foyer is the edge of the living room, a rectangular expanse under a high ceiling. The dining room runs
parallel to the entire length of the living room. This divides into conversation groupings furniture done in
satin beige and peach with draperies to match. The thick rugs mute footsteps on the black marble floors.

2. Topic Sentence:
Proclaiming Ninoy a hero does not guarantee that the race will remember. But it should help. It
should help that, as a hero, his life and deed are engraved in textbooks, relived in skits and songs,
and taught in school. We need only to recall again the letter Jesus Luis de Leon-Borbon wrote here
last month to see how vital-no, how desperate this undertaking is. De Leon, a half-Spaniard, was
looking at the statue of Isidro Torres in Malolos when a group of kids came over and began wondering
who Torres was. Surprised, De Leon volunteered that Torres was a hero who fought by the side of
Gregorio del Pilar. "This del Pilar," said one of the kids, "is he also one of our heroes?"

3. Topic Sentence:
When she was teaching, she would relish the weekends for the endless tasks which she found to be
done in her home. Clothes sorted, darned, set aside for renovation, and she, in close company with the
sewing woman whom she hired for the day. The closets had to be cleared, the plants to be inspected, the
unhealthy and the dying to be made well again, the lush and the flowering to be enjoyed. The kitchen to
be given the week's check-up, marketing, children and husband to be fussed over, enjoyed.

                                            New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a '60s queen
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Now it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

                            18. New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a '60s queen
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Now it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
