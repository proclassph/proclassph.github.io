1. I am composed of the deeper part of crust, mantle, and core;
It’s where the earthquakes originate and make a score,
Seismic waves provide information and record,
That’s why I was investigated and discovered.

2. I am a type of seismic waves,
That travel thousand meters beneath the waves,
When my vibrations reach the earth surface,
It will give rise to a type called surface waves.
What am I? _________________
3. I am commonly called as the S waves,
Rock and solid matter -I can displace,
Moving objects up and down and sideways,
Traveling perpendicular to the direction of my waves.
What am I? __________________
4. A type of S waves that you want to be denied,
Because I shake and move the ground side to side
What am I? _________________
5. I am the vibrations that cause ground shaking,
And the reason why earthquakes are appearing,
My after-effect is infrastructures breaking,
and sometimes the death of many living things.
What am I? _________________
6. I am a type of S waves that make you frown,
Because I do shake the ground up and down
What am I? _________________
7. I am considered as vibrations under primary,
A body waves that cause trouble and make you worry,
In matter with solid, liquid, and even fluid property,
Where I can travel and cause damage severely.
What am I? _________________
8. I am the vibrations on the earth surface,
I have two types the Rayleigh and the Love waves,
I can only move along the earth’s outer layer,
Movement on landforms and ripples on bodies of water.

Bagabaldo Ching and Lu were brothers. They lived in a four-storey building with many other familles. One early dawn in August 1968, the brothers were fall asleep in their room. Suddenly. they were awakened by the strong shaking of the building. Both brothers knew instantly that there was a strong earthquake. In a second, they found themselves buried under tons of bricks, cement and wood. Ching and Lu could hardly move. "Come, Lu," Ching said. "Let us try to get out." "How can I when I can hardly move?" whispered Lu. "Try, dear brother, and pray." Ching said. But Lu did not move. On the other hand, Ching tried to get out of the mounds of rocks and wood. He prayed to God to help. Later he touched the side of a wall. He got a piece of rock and tried to pound on it with all his might. "A Miracle!" cried Ching as he heard someone pounding outside the wall. "They heard me at last! I'll be saved." After long hours of waiting, Ching saw a hole on the wall. Soon he felt strong hands drawing him out of the wall. Ching was saved. But Lu could not save anymore. Help came too late for Lu. He died along with hundreds of people who buried in the building by the strong quake that August dawn. Many people were saved. Like Ching, they believed that God would not forsake them if they helped themselves. God helped them indeed. (Settings || Characters)PLEASE ANSWER (NONSENSE=REPORT)​</a>

One early dawn in August 1968, the brothers were asleep in their brothers knew instantly that there was a strong earthquake. In a second, they room. Suddenly, they were awakened by the strong shaking of the building. Both found themselves buried under tons of bricks, cement and wood. Ching and Lu could hardly move. come, LU " Ching said. " Let us try to get out" " How can I when I can hardly move?" Whispered Lu." Try, dear brother, and pray" Ching said. But Lu did not move and never prayed, instead he said Goodbye brother". On the other hand, Ching tried to get out of the mounds of rocks and wood. He prayed to God to help them. Later he touched the side of a wall. He got a piece of rock and tried to pound on it with all his might. " A miracle!" cried Ching as he heard someone pounding on the opposite side of the wall." They heard me at last!. We'll be saved brother!" After long hours of waiting, Ching saw a hole on the wall. Soon he felt a strong hand drawing him out of the wall. Ching was saved. But Lu could not be saved anymore. Help came too late for Lu. He died along with hundreds of people who were buried by the strong quake on that dawn of August. Ching believed that God would not forsake if only people helped themselves too. 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Write the setting of the story?​</a>

                                            What I Know
Directions: Write TRUE if the statement is correct or FALSE if incorrect.
1. Salinity refers to the amount of salt in water.
2. Kelp, a kind of algae, has strong root like structures that attaches itself to
rocks to keep it from being carried away by the waves.
3. Blue crabs and mangroves have well-adjusted to the constantly changing the
salinity of water due to continuous flow of salt water and fresh water through the estuary.
4. Coral reefs are the areas of estuaries in which part of subtidal zone where
there are abundant organisms.
5. Animals found in the rocky shores are plankton, brittle stars, starfish hermit
crab, barnacles, limpets, mollusks, periwinkle, shore crab,
6. The intertidal area (also called the littoral zone) is where the land and sea
meet, between the high and low tide zones.
7. Many intertidal animals burrow into the sand (like clams), live under rocks, or
attach themselves to rocks (like barnacles and mussels) to survive.
8. Animals that live in the intertidal zone have a wide variety of predators who
eat them.
9. The types of soil differ in the estuaries depending on the strength of waves
and kinds of rocks present in the area.
10. Since many of the organisms in rocky shores are herbivores, seaweeds
provide food for them.​</a>

1. I am composed of the deeper part of crust, mantle, and core;
It’s where the earthquakes originate and make a score,
Seismic waves provide information and record,
That’s why I was investigated and discovered.

2. I am a type of seismic waves,
That travel thousand meters beneath the waves,
When my vibrations reach the earth surface,
It will give rise to a type called surface waves.
What am I? _________________
3. I am commonly called as the S waves,
Rock and solid matter -I can displace,
Moving objects up and down and sideways,
Traveling perpendicular to the direction of my waves.
What am I? __________________
4. A type of S waves that you want to be denied,
Because I shake and move the ground side to side

5. I am the vibrations that cause ground shaking,
And the reason why earthquakes are appearing,
My after-effect is infrastructures breaking,
and sometimes the death of many living things.

6. I am a type of S waves that make you frown,
Because I do shake the ground up and down
What am I? _________________
7. I am considered as vibrations under primary,
A body waves that cause trouble and make you worry,
In matter with solid, liquid, and even fluid property,
Where I can travel and cause damage severely.

8. I am the vibrations on the earth surface,
I have two types the Rayleigh and the Love waves,
I can only move along the earth’s outer layer,
Movement on landforms and ripples on bodies of water.

                                            God Helps Those Who Help Themselves
By Anita A. Bagabaldo
Ching and Lu were brothers. They lived in a four-storey building with many other
humilies
One carly dawn in August 1968, the brothers were fall asleep in their room.
Suddenly, they were awakened by the strong shaking of the building. Both brother
knew instantly that there was a strong carthquake in a second, they found
themselves buried under tons of bricks, cement and wood.
Ching and Lu could hardly move. "Come, Lu." Ching said. "Let us try to get
out.
"How can I when I can hardly move?" whispered Lu. "Try, dear brother, and
pray." Ching said. But Lu did not move. On the other hand, Ching tried to get out of
the mounds of rocks and wood.
He prayed to God to help. Later he touched the side
or a wall. He got a piece of rock and tried to pound on it with all his might
"A Miraclet cried Ching as he heard someone pounding outside the wall. "They
heard me at last be saved."
Arter long hours of waiting. Ching saw a hole on the wall. Soon he felt strong
hands drawing him out of the wall. Ching was saved. But Lu could not save anymore.
Help came too late for Lu. He died along with hundreds of people who buried in the
building by the strong quake that August dawn. Many people were saved. Like Ching.
they believed that God would not forsake them if they helped themselves. God helped
them indeed

1. I am composed of the deeper part of crust, mantle, and core;
It’s where the earthquakes originate and make a score,
Seismic waves provide information and record,
That’s why I was investigated and discovered.
What am I? _________________
2. I am a type of seismic waves,
That travel thousand meters beneath the waves,
When my vibrations reach the earth surface,
It will give rise to a type called surface waves.
What am I? _________________
3. I am commonly called as the S waves,
Rock and solid matter -I can displace,
Moving objects up and down and sideways,
Traveling perpendicular to the direction of my waves.
What am I? __________________
4. A type of S waves that you want to be denied,
Because I shake and move the ground side to side
What am I? _________________
5. I am the vibrations that cause ground shaking,
And the reason why earthquakes are appearing,
My after-effect is infrastructures breaking,
and sometimes the death of many living things.
What am I? _________________
6. I am a type of S waves that make you frown,
Because I do shake the ground up and down
What am I? _________________
7. I am considered as vibrations under primary,
A body waves that cause trouble and make you worry,
In matter with solid, liquid, and even fluid property,
Where I can travel and cause damage severely.
What am I? _________________
8. I am the vibrations on the earth surface,
I have two types the Rayleigh and the Love waves,
I can only move along the earth’s outer layer,
Movement on landforms and ripples on bodies of water.

Suddenly. they were awakened by the strong shaking of the building. Both brothers knew instantly that there was a strong earthquake. In a second, they found themselves buried under tons of bricks, cement and wood. Ching and Lu could hardly move. "Come, Lu," Ching said. "Let us try to get out." "How can I when I can hardly move?" whispered Lu. "Try, dear brother, and pray." Ching said. But Lu did not move. On the other hand, Ching tried to get out of the mounds of rocks and wood. He prayed to God to help. Later he touched the side of a wall. He got a piece of rock and tried to pound on it with all his might. "A Miracle!" cried Ching as he heard someone pounding outside the wall. "They heard me at last! I'll be saved." After long hours of waiting, Ching saw a hole on the wall. Soon he felt strong hands drawing him out of the wall. Ching was saved. But Lu could not save anymore. Help came too late for Lu. He died along with hundreds of people who buried in the building by the strong quake that August dawn. Many people were saved.

                            28. God Helps Those Who Help Themselves
By Anita A. Bagabaldo
Ching and Lu were brothers. They lived in a four-storey building with many other
humilies
One carly dawn in August 1968, the brothers were fall asleep in their room.
Suddenly, they were awakened by the strong shaking of the building. Both brother
knew instantly that there was a strong carthquake in a second, they found
themselves buried under tons of bricks, cement and wood.
Ching and Lu could hardly move. "Come, Lu." Ching said. "Let us try to get
out.
"How can I when I can hardly move?" whispered Lu. "Try, dear brother, and
pray." Ching said. But Lu did not move. On the other hand, Ching tried to get out of
the mounds of rocks and wood.
He prayed to God to help. Later he touched the side
or a wall. He got a piece of rock and tried to pound on it with all his might
"A Miraclet cried Ching as he heard someone pounding outside the wall. "They
heard me at last be saved."
Arter long hours of waiting. Ching saw a hole on the wall. Soon he felt strong
hands drawing him out of the wall. Ching was saved. But Lu could not save anymore.
Help came too late for Lu. He died along with hundreds of people who buried in the
building by the strong quake that August dawn. Many people were saved. Like Ching.
they believed that God would not forsake them if they helped themselves. God helped
them indeed
