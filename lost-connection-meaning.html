"Cell phones don't contribute to learning andare potentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education."There are already enough distractions; there's no need to add another."Sherman, who researches how children leam, explains that cell phones may inhibityounger children from leaming the full range of communication."Cell phones mediate or 'stand between people," he says. The words are sent butthe non-verbal information is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, andphysical gestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. Whencommunication is frequently mediated, it is possible children will not leam these subtleaspects of communicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones,computer e-mail, and video. It is appropriate to limit this mediated communication withyoung children.Modern cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" worries manyeducators. Children can spend two to four hours each day in front of screens. Much of thistime has limited physical and mental activity. Often solitary entertainment screen time canoccupy the majority of children's out of school free time. Educators recommend that childrenengage in active play, read, play social board games, and fantasy play. "Screen time shouldbe limitedSherman listed a few other reasons for not having cell phones in school includingthat the ringing can be a distraction. Cell phones could contribute to social inequitiescreating a new level of "have/have-not" distinction. There may also be a "keep up withJones" response as new and fancier phone technology comes along. Cell phones are smalland getting smaller, thus, are easily lost and a potential target for theft"There are no good reasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of thereasons frequently given for youngsters to have cell phones is to allow them to be able tocontact someone in an emergency. "But schools are safe places so emergencies don'thappen often," Sherman says. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies andmaking the appropriate contacts. Besides, it is not good to give children the impressionschools are unsafe exactly the opposite of the truth."There really are no clear learning related uses," Sherman says, "and severaldisadvantages."It also is not accurate for families to think that the cell phone is making it easier fordaily planning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make plans-thusnecessitating a call to the child—is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaming to plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed and within a well-planned context."Young students don't need this electronic tether to home and parents. They shouldlearn to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children can't make, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leam to be independent thinkers. Wejust don't need to be so 'connected," Sherman says.​</a>

                                            Identify the type of foreshadowing used in the following and explain what event it foreshadows.
1. In the early episodes of Game of Thrones, Viserys Targaryen appears to be a major threat – he is the son of the Mad King, and obsessed with conquering the Westlands and reclaiming his father’s throne. However, Viserys doesn’t make it past the first season; he is immediately killed after upsetting Khal Drogo. We soon realize that his sister, Daenerys, is the real threat.
2.There have been a series of lost belongings in class.  The students believe that the one who is getting their things is the classmate who is the most timid and the loner whom no one wants to befriend because he is the only poor among them.
3.Throughout the novel, Pip believes his benefactor is Miss Havisham, and for good reason. Too many coincidences and people around her became close to Pip during his time in London. However, in the end, he learns it was his convict.
4. Pip is given the conditions of his expectations from Jaggers. He stated that Pip may not inquire by any means who his benefactor is, until the time they choose to reveal themselves.
5. An old man is seated at his desk looking at his stamp collection.  When he opens the drawer for his magnifying glass, his fingers brush against a revolver.  He finds the magnifying glass and closes the drawer.
6.Pip mentions that the stranger in the bar stirred his drink with a file. This foreshadowed a connection with the first convict, who the reader later learns is Pip's benefactor.
7. It was the first time Mary’s husband has been very late for coming home.  She was very worried because he never answers her phone call.  When she opens her curtain, the night is so dark and only the flashing lightning is the source of light.
8.The scene is on a Wild West saloon.  The hero walks in and orders whiskey.  Over the corner, the villain watches him drink.  As the hero leaves, the villain spits on the floor.
9.In the first episode of Firefly, the crew accidentally take a Federal agent on board, and have to figure out which of their passengers it is. All clues point to Simon Tam, a mysterious figure who asks lots of questions and refuses to discuss his reason for being on the ship. However, it turns out Simon is not the agent – rather, he is a fugitive from the law, which explains his unwillingness to talk openly about his past.
10.When a fortune-teller looks into her crystal ball, she closes her eyes and crosses herself.</a>

FACT OR BIASDIRECTION: Read the orticle, then identify the statements by writing them on their appropriatecolumn for facts or biases."CELL PHONES DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO LEARNING"Peopie are using cell phones everywhere, even in schools, leading some school systemsio ban them duting the academic day. "OCell phones don't confribute to leaming ond arepotentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education. "Thereare aready ernough distractions; there's no needto add another.""Cell phones medicte or stond between' people," he says. The words are seni but threnon-verbol informotion is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, and physicalgestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. When communication isfrequently medioted, it is possible children will not lean these subtle aspects ofcommunicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones, computer e-mail, and video. It is oppropriate to limit this mediated comnunication with young children.Modem cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" woies many educators.Children can spendtwo to four hours eoch day in front of screens. Much of this fime has limitedphysical and mental octivity. Often solitary entertainment screen time can occupy themajority of children's out of school free fime. Educators recommend that children engage inactive ploy, read, play social boord games, and fantasy play. "Screen time" should be limited.Sherman listed a few olher reasons tor not having cell phones in school inncluding thatthe ringing can be a distiaction. Ceilphones could contribste to social inequities creating anew level ot "have/hove-no" distinclion. There may aiso be o "keep up with Jones" responseas new and lancier phone technology comes clong. Cell phones cre srmall and geltingsmaller, thus, are easily lost and a potentiol target for thefl."There are no goodreasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of the reasonsfrequently given for youngsters to hove cell phones is to allow them to be able to contactsomeone in arı emergency. "8ut schools are safe places so emergencies don't happen offten."Shermon soys. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies and making the appropriate contacts. Besides. il is not good to give children the impression schools are unsote- exactly the opposite of the truth."There realy areno clear leaming-related uses," Shermon says, "and severaldisadvantoges."li also is not occurate for fomilies to think that the cell phone is makingit easier for datyplanning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make pions thusnecessitating a call to the child - is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaning lo plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed ond within a well-planned confext."Young students don't need this elechionic tether to home and parents. They shouldlean to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children con't moke, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leorn to be indepencient thinkers. Wejust don't need to be so 'connected,"Sherman says.Fact1234Bias5678Plss help po ty​</a>

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                                            Amelia Earheart: The Lady LindyAmelia Mary Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, on July 24, 1897.During Christmas vacation in 1917 at an aviation expo, a pilot flew his planenear her. Latershe said, "I believe that little red airplane said something to meas it swished by." However, a 10-minute plane ride in December 1920 changedher life. "By the time I had got two or three hundred feet off the ground, I knew Ihad to fly," she said.She purchased her first plane, a bright yellow, second-hand biplane that shenamed The Canary and she eventually achieved the world altitude record for womenpilots 14 000 feet in October 1922. She became an aviation celebrity and thepress dubbed her "Lady Lindy.” George P. Putnam, who published many storiesabout Charles Lindbergh, took on Earhart's story as his next bestseller. Earhartmarried Putnam and worked closely during appearances, lectures and otherpromotions on many industries including women's fashion, magazines and airlinemanagement. Her true passion, however, always remained with flying. She set aworld record for altitude, reaching 18,415 feet, and became president of The Ninety-Nines, an organization dedicated to women's aviation. For some time, Earhart andPutnam worked secretly on plans for Earhart to make a solo flight across theAtlantic. This would be the first woman and second solo person to make the flight.On June 1, 1937. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, departedfrom Miami with great fanfare. They began the 29,000-mile journey heading east.After 29 days of flight, they touched down in Lae, New Guinea. When Earhartand Noonan took off from Lae, they encountered problems over the Pacific withovercast skies and rain showers early on. As they neared Howland Island, theywere unable to make sufficient connection with the Itasca or to land on theisland.

Highlight the facts and box the opinions.Cell Phones Don't Contribute to Learningby Mary Ann JohnsonPeople are using cell phones everywhere, even in schools, leading some schoolsystems to ban them during the academic day. "Cell phones don't contribute to learning andare potentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education."There are already enough distractions; there's no need to add another."Sherman, who researches how children leam, explains that cell phones may inhibityounger children from leaming the full range of communication."Cell phones mediate or 'stand between people," he says. The words are sent butthe non-verbal information is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, andphysical gestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. Whencommunication is frequently mediated, it is possible children will not leam these subtleaspects of communicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones,computer e-mail, and video. It is appropriate to limit this mediated communication withyoung children.Modern cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" worries manyeducators. Children can spend two to four hours each day in front of screens. Much of thistime has limited physical and mental activity. Often solitary entertainment screen time canoccupy the majority of children's out of school free time. Educators recommend that childrenengage in active play, read, play social board games, and fantasy play. "Screen time shouldbe limitedSherman listed a few other reasons for not having cell phones in school includingthat the ringing can be a distraction. Cell phones could contribute to social inequitiescreating a new level of "have/have-not" distinction. There may also be a "keep up withJones" response as new and fancier phone technology comes along. Cell phones are smalland getting smaller, thus, are easily lost and a potential target for theft"There are no good reasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of thereasons frequently given for youngsters to have cell phones is to allow them to be able tocontact someone in an emergency. "But schools are safe places so emergencies don'thappen often," Sherman says. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies andmaking the appropriate contacts. Besides, it is not good to give children the impressionschools are unsafe exactly the opposite of the truth."There really are no clear learning related uses," Sherman says, "and severaldisadvantages."It also is not accurate for families to think that the cell phone is making it easier fordaily planning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make plans-thusnecessitating a call to the child—is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaming to plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed and within a well-planned context."Young students don't need this electronic tether to home and parents. They shouldlearn to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children can't make, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leam to be independent thinkers. Wejust don't need to be so 'connected," Sherman says.​</h2><br />

                            6. Identify the type of foreshadowing used in the following and explain what event it foreshadows.
1. In the early episodes of Game of Thrones, Viserys Targaryen appears to be a major threat – he is the son of the Mad King, and obsessed with conquering the Westlands and reclaiming his father’s throne. However, Viserys doesn’t make it past the first season; he is immediately killed after upsetting Khal Drogo. We soon realize that his sister, Daenerys, is the real threat.
2.There have been a series of lost belongings in class.  The students believe that the one who is getting their things is the classmate who is the most timid and the loner whom no one wants to befriend because he is the only poor among them.
3.Throughout the novel, Pip believes his benefactor is Miss Havisham, and for good reason. Too many coincidences and people around her became close to Pip during his time in London. However, in the end, he learns it was his convict.
4. Pip is given the conditions of his expectations from Jaggers. He stated that Pip may not inquire by any means who his benefactor is, until the time they choose to reveal themselves.
5. An old man is seated at his desk looking at his stamp collection.  When he opens the drawer for his magnifying glass, his fingers brush against a revolver.  He finds the magnifying glass and closes the drawer.
6.Pip mentions that the stranger in the bar stirred his drink with a file. This foreshadowed a connection with the first convict, who the reader later learns is Pip's benefactor.
7. It was the first time Mary’s husband has been very late for coming home.  She was very worried because he never answers her phone call.  When she opens her curtain, the night is so dark and only the flashing lightning is the source of light.
8.The scene is on a Wild West saloon.  The hero walks in and orders whiskey.  Over the corner, the villain watches him drink.  As the hero leaves, the villain spits on the floor.
9.In the first episode of Firefly, the crew accidentally take a Federal agent on board, and have to figure out which of their passengers it is. All clues point to Simon Tam, a mysterious figure who asks lots of questions and refuses to discuss his reason for being on the ship. However, it turns out Simon is not the agent – rather, he is a fugitive from the law, which explains his unwillingness to talk openly about his past.
10.When a fortune-teller looks into her crystal ball, she closes her eyes and crosses herself.</h2><br />

                            14. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                            17. Amelia Earheart: The Lady LindyAmelia Mary Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, on July 24, 1897.During Christmas vacation in 1917 at an aviation expo, a pilot flew his planenear her. Latershe said, "I believe that little red airplane said something to meas it swished by." However, a 10-minute plane ride in December 1920 changedher life. "By the time I had got two or three hundred feet off the ground, I knew Ihad to fly," she said.She purchased her first plane, a bright yellow, second-hand biplane that shenamed The Canary and she eventually achieved the world altitude record for womenpilots 14 000 feet in October 1922. She became an aviation celebrity and thepress dubbed her "Lady Lindy.” George P. Putnam, who published many storiesabout Charles Lindbergh, took on Earhart's story as his next bestseller. Earhartmarried Putnam and worked closely during appearances, lectures and otherpromotions on many industries including women's fashion, magazines and airlinemanagement. Her true passion, however, always remained with flying. She set aworld record for altitude, reaching 18,415 feet, and became president of The Ninety-Nines, an organization dedicated to women's aviation. For some time, Earhart andPutnam worked secretly on plans for Earhart to make a solo flight across theAtlantic. This would be the first woman and second solo person to make the flight.On June 1, 1937. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, departedfrom Miami with great fanfare. They began the 29,000-mile journey heading east.After 29 days of flight, they touched down in Lae, New Guinea. When Earhartand Noonan took off from Lae, they encountered problems over the Pacific withovercast skies and rain showers early on. As they neared Howland Island, theywere unable to make sufficient connection with the Itasca or to land on theisland. Though the Itasca began a rescue attempt immediately and the searchcontinued for weeks, nothing was found. On January 5, 1939, Earhart wasdeclared legally dead. Her disappearance during this attempt to fly around theworld is a mystery that continues to intrigue people worldwide.Antoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger de Saint-Exupery's LifeAntoine de Saint-Exupery (1900-1944), a French writer and aviator. He wasborn in Lyon and educated at the University of Fribourg. He joined the French AirForce in 1921 and became a commercial pilot in 1926.9His first two books, Southern Mail (1929) and Night flight (1931), are novelsdistinguished by a poetic evocation of the romance and discipline of flying, whichrequires devotion to duty at the risk of death. His later works, including Wind,Sand and Stars (1939), and Flight to Arras (1942), stress the humanisticPhilosophy of Saint-Exupery. His popular children's book The Little Prince (1943)is also read by adults for its allegorical meaning,During World War II, Saint-Exupery rejoined the French Air Force, was shot,escaped to the United States, and later joined the Free French Forces. On areconnaissance mission over southern France in 1944, his plane was lost. Theremains of the aircraft were not found until 2004 when scuba divers recovered atailpiece bearing the serial number of the aircraft Saint-Exupery was flying, aLockheed P-38 Lightning. The cause of the crash is still unknown. Saint-Exupery'snotebooks, collected under the title "Wisdom of the Sands" (1948), were publishedposthumously.​</h2><br />
