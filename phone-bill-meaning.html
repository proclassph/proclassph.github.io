                                            Prepaid and Postpaid phone plans: What is the difference?
Jacqui Dent
A prepaid plan is a plan where you "recharge" your account at the start
of the billing cycle. Recharges come in a range of prices with varying
inclusions, and you are free to switch which recharge option you choose
every time you top up. It means you pay for your phone service upfront.
Prepaid recharges don't last forever. Most operate on a 28-day expiry
cycle and stipulate that any remaining inclusions are wiped clean when
you reach the end of the expiry period.
On the flip side, if you use up all of your credit before the end of the
expiry period, you will need to recharge your account before you can use
this part of your service again. For example, if you reach your data limit
your internet connection will pause, but you'll still be able to make and
receive calls and messages on plans with unlimited calling and text
inclusions.
A postpaid plan is a contract where you use your plan's inclusions, and
agree to pay the set price at the end of the billing cycle (usually on a
monthly basis).
On a postpaid plan, you pay at the end of the month based on your
usage. You choose a plan and every month your telco will bill you and
automatically refresh your plan inclusions on the first day of your billing
cycle. Postpaid plans can be SIM-only which means you only pay for the
phone service or they can come with a mobile phone included. Postpaid
plans almost always include unlimited talk and text, which means the
main point of difference is how much data you get.</a>

Valuing! Directions. Read the situation and explain your answer.
Energy is very important in our everyday life. For example, we use different energy
sources to generate the electricity that we need for our homes, schools, businesses, and
factories. Electricity powers our television sets, electric fans, washing machines,
desktops computers, cellular phones, tablets, and laptops. We also use energy to run
motorcycles, jeeps, cars, buses, trains, and airplanes.
During the pandemic we are constrained in the four walls of our house. Because
of this, there is a tendency to have a higher consumption of electricity. And higher
electricity consumption means higher electric bills. Therefore, it is very important for us
to conserve our electricity.
How can you help conserve electricity at home? Why?</a>

                            2. Prepaid and Postpaid phone plans: What is the difference?
Jacqui Dent
A prepaid plan is a plan where you "recharge" your account at the start
of the billing cycle. Recharges come in a range of prices with varying
inclusions, and you are free to switch which recharge option you choose
every time you top up. It means you pay for your phone service upfront.
Prepaid recharges don't last forever. Most operate on a 28-day expiry
cycle and stipulate that any remaining inclusions are wiped clean when
you reach the end of the expiry period.
On the flip side, if you use up all of your credit before the end of the
expiry period, you will need to recharge your account before you can use
this part of your service again. For example, if you reach your data limit
your internet connection will pause, but you'll still be able to make and
receive calls and messages on plans with unlimited calling and text
inclusions.
A postpaid plan is a contract where you use your plan's inclusions, and
agree to pay the set price at the end of the billing cycle (usually on a
monthly basis).
On a postpaid plan, you pay at the end of the month based on your
usage. You choose a plan and every month your telco will bill you and
automatically refresh your plan inclusions on the first day of your billing
cycle. Postpaid plans can be SIM-only which means you only pay for the
phone service or they can come with a mobile phone included. Postpaid
plans almost always include unlimited talk and text, which means the
main point of difference is how much data you get.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Prepaid, as the name implies, is a service that requires payment in advance. Every telecom provider in the country offers a diverse range of prepaid plans and add-ons to their customers. Any prepaid user can select any of the prepaid plans that meet their needs and recharge with add-on packs like top-ups as well as talktime top-ups if their prepaid plans are insufficient.</p><p></p><p>In a postpaid connection, users receive services from cellular providers and are then asked to pay the bill at the end of the billing cycle. Users, like prepaid subscribers, can select from a variety of postpaid plans offered by their operators. Their postpaid bill, as well as their consumption, will be covered by the plan they have chosen</p><br />

                            3. Learning Task 3
Valuing! Directions. Read the situation and explain your answer.
Energy is very important in our everyday life. For example, we use different energy
sources to generate the electricity that we need for our homes, schools, businesses, and
factories. Electricity powers our television sets, electric fans, washing machines,
desktops computers, cellular phones, tablets, and laptops. We also use energy to run
motorcycles, jeeps, cars, buses, trains, and airplanes.
During the pandemic we are constrained in the four walls of our house. Because
of this, there is a tendency to have a higher consumption of electricity. And higher
electricity consumption means higher electric bills. Therefore, it is very important for us
to conserve our electricity.
How can you help conserve electricity at home? Why?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There is widespread popular support for using renewable energy, particularly solar and wind energy, which provide electricity without giving rise to any carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>Harnessing these for electricity depends on the cost and efficiency of the technology, which is constantly improving, thus reducing costs per peak kilowatt, and per kWh at the source.</p><p>Utilising electricity from solar and wind in a grid becomes problematical at high levels for complex but now well-demonstrated reasons. Supply does not correspond with demand.</p><p>Back-up generating capacity is required due to the intermittent nature of solar and wind. System costs escalate with increasing proportion of variable renewables.</p><p>Policy settings to support renewables are generally required to confer priority in grid systems and also subsidise them, and some 50 countries have these provisions.</p><p>Utilising solar and wind-generated electricity in a stand-alone system requires corresponding battery or other storage capacity.</p><p>The possibility of large-scale use of hydrogen in the future as a transport fuel increases the potential for both renewables and base-load electricity supply.</p><br />
