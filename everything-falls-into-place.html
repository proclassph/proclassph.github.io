                                            THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

Your dazzling smile, the one I always seek. Everytime you turn, everything clicks. You can't leave my head, like a score in a test. Your actions said you love me, But I can't love you, I need to crush you. Like a hot weather does to a sundae. This feeling feeling so down, I wonder If I can win. In a glimpse Everything sinked I've fallen deep with my emulate I'm overdue you're already in the blue While I'm still here waiting for you Wasn't able to bring out the desires of my heart That everything is requite That I was only for thee If paths crossed once more in the right hour I can finally inform That you're the one I adorecan explain this plssss kung ano Po yung emotions niya or ano ring yung thoughts nung writer.

                            29. THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.
