                        In my opinion, you should look for clues that are given in the sentence. For example, “She must be exhausted because she works at day and studies at night.” So the word here is “exhausted”, how would you know the meaning? Understand the given sentence. She works at day, and studies at night so she must be exhausted. She must be tired. Hope it helps.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1.We look hard at how we arrange the sense. What we try to do is not necessarily have the primary sense of a word as the commonest sense, but as the most literal and typical meaning of the word. First of all, you use your intuition and a feel for the word and what it means; everybody has that.People decide what a word means. Before words enter into the official lexicon or dictionary, people need to use it first in writing and speech. The meaning of the word can shift, but once it's meaning is commonly agreed on, it can enter the official English language. People determine what words mean...Word choice is critical to your writing.

The structure of language is its grammar and the free components are its vocabulary. Many languages, including the most widely-spoken ones, have writing systems that enable sounds or signs to be recorded for later reactivation. Human language is unique among known systems of animal communication in that it is not dependent on a single mode of transmission (sight, sound etc.), it is highly variable between cultures and across time, and affords a much wider range of expression than other systems. It has the properties of productivity and displacement, and relies on social convention and learning.<p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>HOPE IT HELPS CARRY ON LEARNING PAKIBRAINLIEST AT PAKIFOLLOW NALANG PO STAY SAFE GUYS ❤️❤️❤️.<br />

We are here because we have a purpose or mission to accomplish and when we already finished the task that's when our life will end.  Morally speaking,  When we reach the point of ending it is the time when we realized that our life span was not just for enjoyment, sadness, nor permanent a thing.
