The Legend of Rice
Long ago, people did not plant crops or raise animals for food. The relied only on nature and their surroundings. They would live in places where they could find food. Some stayed in caves and lived on fruits and animal meat. Some stayed by riverbank and the sea so they could fish for their food. They would stay in a place until food got scarce and then move to another place where food was bountiful. The couple Banag and Danas belonged to a group who used to live near the sea. They were looking for a new place. A fierce storm had destroyed their houses near the sea. They feared the coming of another storm. “Why do we always move our home?” Banag asked Danas.” I am tired of this kind of life. We cannot even have children because we keep moving.” Banag wanted to separate from the rest of the group and stay behind in a pleasant place. “I want to bear our child there.” Danas gave in to his wife’s request. They chose a nice place in the mountains and built a simple house there. Their new home was tranquil, and food was bountiful. Nearby was a clear stream where Danas caught many fish. But then came a drought. For a long time, no rain fell, and the earth dried up. Plants and trees died, and birds and animals disappeared. Fish perished in the dried stream. Danas travelled far to look for food. But the drought was merciless. He traveled until he reached the next mountain. Still, he could not find food. Exhaustion caught up with Danas in the middle of the vast field. He lay among the grasses and fell asleep. Suddenly, the wind blew, and the grasses
danced and sang, Danas woke up surprised. Danas listened to the song of the grasses. “We are the hope of the people, Danas, gather our grains, our grains are good food.” Danas noticed the head of the grasses. Each head was full of golden grains. He picked a grain and bit it. “Pound our grains to remove their golden covers. “Sang the grasses.” Cook the white kernels inside the grains to soften them. It is good food. Danas gathered the grains until his bag was full and then hurriedly went home to Banag. “Now we have food,” he happily told Banag. He removed the golden covers of the grains, as the grasses had instructed him, cooked the grains and eat them. The next morning, Danas returned to the field, plant our grains “sang the grasses.” Plant them on land softened by rain. They will grow, and you will take care of them. When you harvest, save some grains to plant again. Learn to plant and take care of plants. Planting will become your source of livelihood.

It seems that more and more accidents happen outdoors at
night. One way to save yourself is by wearing a bright clothing so that
cars can see you. White is a good color. If you are riding a bike, be
sure that it has plenty of reflectors or headlamps. You should also
take care when crossing the street because sometimes drivers cannot
see you in the glare of their headlights. Or better yet, avoid going out
at night unless it is a necessity.</a>

                                            As the dismaying predicament seemed beyond solution, Rizal’s nimble brain conceived a cute solution. Appearing perfectly at ease, he turned to the waiter and said, “My dear fellow,” he spoke in French, “don’t you worry.” Pointing to Luna with a flourish of his hand, he said, “Monsieur is quite right. I am the host of this party and I will take care of everything. But first, let my guests complete their meal. We must have black coffee and the best brandy the house can offer. I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.

This is one of our positive habits until we invite guests to our kitchen or dining area.</p><p></p><p>A typical Filipino fridge is usually stocked with recycled plastic bottles in all sizes containing drinking water. In the same manner, we love buying hefty glass jars of instant coffee or peanut butter because they can be reused as drinking glasses.</p><p></p><p>Well, it’s all fun and games until someone gets hurt (or dies!) of either cancer from the chemicals leaching off the overused plastic bottles, or food poisoning from the ancient containers getting contaminated with a sundry of condiments and other substances that haven’t been washed off thoroughly.</p><p>2Speaking of rice, there’s no doubt we Filipinos are a rice-eating people. We consider meals without rice to be mere snacks, and all a restaurant has to do to get our attention and money is to offer “unlimited rice.”</p><p></p><p>Despite knowing the horrible effects of excessive carb consumption on our health (see ‘diabetes,’ ‘obesity,’ and ‘just plain feeling sleepy most of the time’), we insist on having our favorite carbohydrate with practically everything.</p><p></p><p>Is our obsession with rice just another chapter from our nation’s multi-volume book, Making the Most of What’s in Front of You?

The Legend of Rice
Long ago, people did not plant crops or raise animals for food. The relied only on nature and their surroundings. They would live in places where they could find food. Some stayed in caves and lived on fruits and animal meat. Some stayed by riverbank and the sea so they could fish for their food. They would stay in a place until food got scarce and then move to another place where food was bountiful. The couple Banag and Danas belonged to a group who used to live near the sea. They were looking for a new place. A fierce storm had destroyed their houses near the sea. They feared the coming of another storm. “Why do we always move our home?” Banag asked Danas.” I am tired of this kind of life. We cannot even have children because we keep moving.” Banag wanted to separate from the rest of the group and stay behind in a pleasant place. “I want to bear our child there.” Danas gave in to his wife’s request. They chose a nice place in the mountains and built a simple house there. Their new home was tranquil, and food was bountiful. Nearby was a clear stream where Danas caught many fish. But then came a drought. For a long time, no rain fell, and the earth dried up. Plants and trees died, and birds and animals disappeared. Fish perished in the dried stream. Danas travelled far to look for food. But the drought was merciless. He traveled until he reached the next mountain. Still, he could not find food. Exhaustion caught up with Danas in the middle of the vast field. He lay among the grasses and fell asleep. Suddenly, the wind blew, and the grasses
danced and sang, Danas woke up surprised. Danas listened to the song of the grasses. “We are the hope of the people, Danas, gather our grains, our grains are good food.” Danas noticed the head of the grasses. Each head was full of golden grains. He picked a grain and bit it. “Pound our grains to remove their golden covers. “Sang the grasses.” Cook the white kernels inside the grains to soften them. It is good food. Danas gathered the grains until his bag was full and then hurriedly went home to Banag. “Now we have food,” he happily told Banag. He removed the golden covers of the grains, as the grasses had instructed him, cooked the grains and eat them. The next morning, Danas returned to the field, plant our grains “sang the grasses.” Plant them on land softened by rain. They will grow, and you will take care of them. When you harvest, save some grains to plant again. Learn to plant and take care of plants. Planting will become your source of livelihood.

It seems that more and more accidents happen outdoors at
night. One way to save yourself is by wearing a bright clothing so that
cars can see you. White is a good color. If you are riding a bike, be
sure that it has plenty of reflectors or headlamps. You should also
take care when crossing the street because sometimes drivers cannot
see you in the glare of their headlights. Or better yet, avoid going out
at night unless it is a necessity.</h2><br />

                            21. As the dismaying predicament seemed beyond solution, Rizal’s nimble brain conceived a cute solution. Appearing perfectly at ease, he turned to the waiter and said, “My dear fellow,” he spoke in French, “don’t you worry.” Pointing to Luna with a flourish of his hand, he said, “Monsieur is quite right. I am the host of this party and I will take care of everything. But first, let my guests complete their meal. We must have black coffee and the best brandy the house can offer. I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.

                            23. As the dismaying predicament seemed beyond solution, Rizal’s nimble brain conceived a cute solution. Appearing perfectly at ease, he turned to the waiter and said, “My dear fellow,” he spoke in French, “don’t you worry.” Pointing to Luna with a flourish of his hand, he said, “Monsieur is quite right. I am the host of this party and I will take care of everything. But first, let my guests complete their meal. We must have black coffee and the best brandy the house can offer. I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.Comprehension Check: What do you suppose happened right after?
