                                            Read the story. Then answer the questions. Miss Beth Bayless lived alone in an old timber house with a tiny garden in front. Her house had a steep roof which came down like a hat over the eyes of the windows. One day after shopping, as she fumbling in her purse for her front door key, she noticed a little plant growing in a crack in the concrete path. She put her basket and took a sharp knife. She pushed the knife down the side of the little plant and loosened it from the stony earth. It came up easily, roots and all. She hurried to get a trowel and dig a patch of earth near a verandah post. By next morning when Miss Bayless went out, the seedling had not only shot up over the stake, but had reached the verandah post. And the leaves! How richly green and glossy they were! Within a week, the plant had grown to the top of the post, and had even covered the inside of the verandah and begun spreading over the roof. She was fascinated with its speed, and with the way they seemed not to cover the windows and door, but just to frame them. She loved it. But the neighbours didn't. Mr. Drummond came, "Miss Bayless, I think you ought to take it out before it does some serious damage." Don't worry, Mr. Drummond, I'm not at all concerned." Everyone in the street came to stare the creepers. Next morning, as she opened the door, she smelt the most delicious scent. And there was the fruit a rosy golden ripe ball! She twisted it off the vine and gently cut open. Oh! It was the most mouth-watering taste of her life! And the delicious smell reminded Miss Bayless of her childhood. Her mind raced back to thoughts of those happy carefree days. Five boys and girls, full of smiles, and eyes shining, crowded around her. Then she led the way to the backyard, and the fun began! All day long, they run and climbed trees, and had a picnic. As soon as the sun dipped down over the old walnut tree, she could imagine her five friends saying goodbye. "I wonder," Miss Bayless said aloud, "will children come today?" Answer each question. 1. Who was Miss Beth Bayless and how was her house? 2. What did Miss Bayless notice when she came back from shopping? 3. What did Miss Bayless do then? 4. What happened by the next morning? 5. How the plant had grown? 6. What happened when she opened the door? Ceau alichlian co​</a>

Fill in the missing boxes with the appropriate information. 1. Fernando Amorsolo (1892-1972) is often known as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art". The Spanish-trained realist developed a backlighting technique, where his colorful depictions of local people reflect the radiance of the Philippine sun. The figures and illuminated landscapes magically glow on the canvas. Despite his deteriorating health and failing eyesight, he remained prolific until the end, producing up to 10 paintings a month until his death at the age of 80. Amorsolo's creativity defines the nation's culture and heritage to this day.Fernando AmorsoloKnown as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art"10 paintings(1).80yrs. old(2).​</a>

                            19. Read the story. Then answer the questions. Miss Beth Bayless lived alone in an old timber house with a tiny garden in front. Her house had a steep roof which came down like a hat over the eyes of the windows. One day after shopping, as she fumbling in her purse for her front door key, she noticed a little plant growing in a crack in the concrete path. She put her basket and took a sharp knife. She pushed the knife down the side of the little plant and loosened it from the stony earth. It came up easily, roots and all. She hurried to get a trowel and dig a patch of earth near a verandah post. By next morning when Miss Bayless went out, the seedling had not only shot up over the stake, but had reached the verandah post. And the leaves! How richly green and glossy they were! Within a week, the plant had grown to the top of the post, and had even covered the inside of the verandah and begun spreading over the roof. She was fascinated with its speed, and with the way they seemed not to cover the windows and door, but just to frame them. She loved it. But the neighbours didn't. Mr. Drummond came, "Miss Bayless, I think you ought to take it out before it does some serious damage." Don't worry, Mr. Drummond, I'm not at all concerned." Everyone in the street came to stare the creepers. Next morning, as she opened the door, she smelt the most delicious scent. And there was the fruit a rosy golden ripe ball! She twisted it off the vine and gently cut open. Oh! It was the most mouth-watering taste of her life! And the delicious smell reminded Miss Bayless of her childhood. Her mind raced back to thoughts of those happy carefree days. Five boys and girls, full of smiles, and eyes shining, crowded around her. Then she led the way to the backyard, and the fun began! All day long, they run and climbed trees, and had a picnic. As soon as the sun dipped down over the old walnut tree, she could imagine her five friends saying goodbye. "I wonder," Miss Bayless said aloud, "will children come today?" Answer each question. 1. Who was Miss Beth Bayless and how was her house? 2. What did Miss Bayless notice when she came back from shopping? 3. What did Miss Bayless do then? 4. What happened by the next morning? 5. How the plant had grown? 6.

Fernando Amorsolo (1892-1972) is often known as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art". The Spanish-trained realist developed a backlighting technique, where his colorful depictions of local people reflect the radiance of the Philippine sun. The figures and illuminated landscapes magically glow on the canvas. Despite his deteriorating health and failing eyesight, he remained prolific until the end, producing up to 10 paintings a month until his death at the age of 80. Amorsolo's creativity defines the nation's culture and heritage to this day.Fernando AmorsoloKnown as the "Grand Old Man of Philippine Art"10 paintings(1).80yrs. old(2).​</h2><br />
