                                            VIRTUES AMIDST THE PANDEMIC "At the end of the day, all we need is hope and faith." The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been a tragedy for our community and country. With so many parts of our lives that turned upside down, we have to adapt to the "new normal" as our new re ity. Despite the un certainties associated with this crisis, we have seen communities around the world generating hope. Hope provides a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind, even in tragic situations. To have hope, it is important that we feel a sense of meaning in our lives. - In the recent months, we have learned to appreciate two things that give our life meaning - work and connection with friends and family. This pandemic has caused anxieties, fear, and uncertainties. Raising community awareness of mental health issues helps promote a more positive and proactive approach to addressing mental illnesses in this time of pandemic. However, we are capable to be courageous, hopeful, and resilient as we pray for healing around the world. COVID-19 can be considered a blessing in disguise as we look on the brighter side. Because of this global health crisis, we have also learned to value simple things in life. All have been required to stay at home and be with the family. Everyone has started to help each other; family ties have been strengthened. Busy streets and some malls were closed. As a result, pollution was lessened and Mother Earth started to recuperate. We have also realized the importance of hygiene and safety health protocols. The usual daily routine at home and workplace has been changed. Most importantly, we have brought ourselves back again to the Lord and regained our spiritual attachment with Him. This is an awakening call for us to never give up and to see hope in the middle of challenges.what virtue to provide a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind in tragic situations?​</a>

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been a tragedy for our community and country. With so many parts of our lives that turned upside down, we have to adapt to the "new normal" as our new re ity. Despite the un certainties associated with this crisis, we have seen communities around the world generating hope. Hope provides a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind, even in tragic situations. To have hope, it is important that we feel a sense of meaning in our lives. - In the recent months, we have learned to appreciate two things that give our life meaning - work and connection with friends and family. This pandemic has caused anxieties, fear, and uncertainties. Raising community awareness of mental health issues helps promote a more positive and proactive approach to addressing mental illnesses in this time of pandemic. However, we are capable to be courageous, hopeful, and resilient as we pray for healing around the world. COVID-19 can be considered a blessing in disguise as we look on the brighter side. Because of this global health crisis, we have also learned to value simple things in life. All have been required to stay at home and be with the family. Everyone has started to help each other; family ties have been strengthened. Busy streets and some malls were closed. As a result, pollution was lessened and Mother Earth started to recuperate. We have also realized the importance of hygiene and safety health protocols. The usual daily routine at home and workplace has been changed. Most importantly, we have brought ourselves back again to the Lord and regained our spiritual attachment with Him. This is an awakening call for us to never give up and to see hope in the middle of challenges.what virtue to provide a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind in tragic situations?​</h2><br />

                        A Quote on Quote:
"Faith is a house with many rooms."
<p>This quote means that faith is like a house which confines many rooms. Which goes to show that our faith can be expressed in many different ways.  </p>"Doubt is useful; it keeps faith a living thing. After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it is tested."
<p>Doubt makes people eager to know things. As they work on to know many different things, people keeps their faith working too. But once their faith is put under the test or they are being tried, then they will know for themselves whether they have been stronger or whether they are weak and lacks the faith.
</p>"No one has seen that island since, and you’d never read about those trees in any book. And yet, if I hadn’t found those shores I would have died, if I hadn’t discovered that tooth I would have been lost alone forever."
<p>According to Pi, there are things that people never realizes how beautiful they were and they were never noticed of. But, if he never got the chance to reach the shore, he might have died and without his tiger friend he would have been journeying alone.
</p>"Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, He was watching. Even when he seemed indifferent to my suffering, and when I was beyond all hope saving, He gave me rest and gave me a sign to continue my journey.”
“It happened, it happened. Why should it have to mean anything?"
<p>Even if Pi felt that God does not seem to care for him or might have ignored him, he knew that God is looking down on him. God might seem to Pi that is not a caring God but the truth is, God gave him hope and the courage to continue with his journey. He had realized that everything happened for a reason but he cannot understand why since it does not mean anything to him.
</p>"For castaways, who must share their lifeboats with large, dangerous carnivores, it is advisable to establish a territory as your own."
<p>On this part of the story, Pi considers himself a castaway with many companions since he was riding a lifeboat together with his Bengal tiger, a zebra, an orangutan, and a spotted hyena. However, their ride together does not last since everyone needs to survive. Everyone needs to protect himself or oneself in order to survive. This is what Pi is referring to as establishing a territory of your own where nobody can enter or pass.
