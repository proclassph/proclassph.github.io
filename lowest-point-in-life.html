                                            Read this fable, The City Mouse and the Country Mouse. Take note of its elements and then evaluate each of them using the complete guide. Type your answers in the succeeding box. (20 Points)The City Mouse and the Country MouseOnce a little mouse who lived in the country invited a little Mouse from the city to visit him. When the little City Mouse sat down to dinner he was surprised to find that the Country Mouse had nothing to eat except barley and grain.“Really,” he said, “you do not live well at all; you should see how I live! I have all sorts of fine things to eat every day. You must come to visit me and see how nice it is to live in the city.”The little Country Mouse was glad to do this, and after a while he went to the city to visit his friend.The very first place that the City Mouse took the Country Mouse to see was the kitchen cupboard of the house where he lived. There, on the lowest shelf, behind some stone jars, stood a big paper bag of brown sugar. The little City Mouse gnawed a hole in the bag and invited his friend to nibble for himself.The two little mice nibbled and nibbled, and the Country Mouse thought he had never tasted anything so delicious in his life. He was just thinking how lucky the City Mouse was, when suddenly the door opened with a bang, and in came the cook to get some flour.“Run!” whispered the City Mouse. And they ran as fast as they could to the little hole where they had come in. The little Country Mouse was shaking all over when they got safely away, but the little City Mouse said, “That is nothing; she will soon go away and then we can go back.”After the cook had gone away and shut the door they stole softly back, and this time the City Mouse had something new to show: he took the little Country Mouse into a corner on the top shelf, where a big jar of dried prunes stood open. After much tugging and pulling they got a large dried prune out of the jar on to the shelf and began to nibble at it. This was even better than the brown sugar. The little Country Mouse liked the taste so much that he could hardly nibble fast enough. But all at once, in the midst of their eating, there came a scratching at the door and a sharp, loud MIAOUW!“What is that?” said the Country Mouse. The City Mouse just whispered, “Sh!” and ran as fast as he could to the hole.The Country Mouse ran after, you may be sure, as fast as HE could. As soon as they were out of danger the City Mouse said, “That was the old Cat; she is the best mouser in town,–if she once gets you, you are lost.”“This is very terrible,” said the little Country Mouse; “let us not go back to the cupboard again.”“No,” said the City Mouse, “I will take you to the cellar; there is something especial there.”So the City Mouse took his little friend down the cellar stairs and into a big cupboard where there were many shelves. On the shelves were jars of butter, and cheeses in bags and out of bags. Overhead hung bunches of sausages, and there were spicy apples in barrels standing about. It smelled so good that it went to the little Country Mouse’s head. He ran along the shelf and nibbled at a cheese here, and a bit of butter there, until he saw an especially rich, very delicious-smelling piece of cheese on a queer little stand in a corner. He was just on the point of putting his teeth into the cheese when the City Mouse saw him.“Stop! stop!” cried the City Mouse. “That is a trap!”The little Country Mouse stopped and said, “What is a trap?”“That thing is a trap,” said the little City Mouse. “The minute you touch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head hard, and you’re dead.”The little Country Mouse looked at the trap, and he looked at the cheese, and he looked at the little City Mouse. “If you’ll excuse me,” he said, “I think I will go home. I’d rather have barley and grain to eat and eat it in peace and comfort, than have brown sugar and dried prunes and cheese,–and be frightened to death all the time!”So the little Country Mouse went back to his home, and there he stayed all the rest of his life.https://bygosh.com/kids-classics/the-city-mouse-and-the-country-mouse/#Break your PLOT of the story into three parts:1.

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

10. MANILA, Philippines—San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped theTropang Giga’s perfect six-game start to the conference. San Miguel Beer went on a 20-7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. “This is a big game for us and I’m thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there,” said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to4-2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.

                                            Reading Comprehension. Identify the pattern of development used in each paragraph. Then, encircle the transitional devices that shows organization and cohesion. (Need ASAP)1. Making a great cup of tea is easy if you follow these three steps. First, heat a cup of water to a boiling point. Then put the tea bag in the hot water, and let it seep into the hot water for atleast three minutes. Finally, add creamer and sugar to taste. There is nothing tastier than a strong cup of tea early in the morning. Pattern of Development:2. There are three types of family vehicles made in the United States. The first type is the minivan. All American car manufactures make a version of the minivan. Some say that the comfort and amenities of the minivan compare to none. The second type of family vehicle is the SUV. Some SUVs offer four wheel-drive to navigate tough terrains, and they also offer seating for a large crowd. A third type of family vehicles is called the "crossover". These vehicles supposedly have the best features of the sedan. mini-van, and SUV. They are easy to maneuver, look much like a regular sedan, and sit up to six people All of these vehicles are family friendly, they offer safety, roomy comfort, and many extra features to accommodate the special needs of families. Pattern of Development: 3. Although the twin brothers shared many physical characteristics, they handled themselves differently in social situations. Mario was a shy introverted young man. He had few friends and mostly kept to himself. On the other hand, Gino was outgoing and the life of the party. Unlike Mario Gino had many friends and felt totally at ease among big crowds. The best way to tell these identical twins apart is to invite both to a party and observe how differently they interact with the other guests. Pattern of Development: 4. There are many reasons why I enjoy walking tours when visiting new cities. For starters, walking through a city allows the visitor to see the details of an area without having to hurry. This often results in meeting locals and experiencing their lives and traditions first hand. Furthermore, walking tours are flexible and inexpensive because there are no strict schedules or transportation expenses. Travelers taking walking tours are rewarded with first hand experiences of the places they visit and the opportunity to personally interact with the people who live there. Pattern of Development: 5. The Washington Monument is divided into three main areas. The lowest section of the building houses the entrance, a gift shop, and a restaurant. The middle section consists of elevators and stairways to the top. The top section of the monument includes an observation deck with a spectacular view of the Washington DC area. When I visited the Washington Monument, I toured every section but enjoyed the spectacular 180 degree view the most.Pattern of Development:​</a>

Question:What your opinion about the statement??​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>    1.The boy helping his parents on weekends selling their harvested tilapia in the market shows a positive attitude towards responsibility and family. It is a commendable act that teaches the value of hard work, dedication, and family support. Therefore, my stand on the boy's attitude is positive.</p><p></p><p>   2.Margarita's decision not to spend her money during recess time is commendable. It shows that she is saving her money for a particular purpose or goal, which is a good practice. Therefore, my opinion about the sentence is that it reflects a wise financial decision.</p><p></p><p>    3.I agree with the statement that the secret of a good life is contentment and peace of mind. True happiness and fulfillment come from being content with what we have and finding peace within ourselves. It is not about material possessions or status, but rather about finding joy in simple things and being grateful for what we have.</p><p></p><p>    4.I disagree with the sentence that age is not the basis of our life span. Age is a significant factor in determining our life span. However, there are other factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and environment that also play a role. Therefore, while age is not the only determining factor, it is an essential component of our life span.</p><p></p><p>    5.I completely agree with the statement that people who help us during our difficult times are the ones we need to cherish in our lives. These are the people who support us, love us unconditionally, and help us to overcome our challenges. They deserve our gratitude and respect, and we should cherish them for the rest of our lives.</p><br />

                            15. Read this fable, The City Mouse and the Country Mouse. Take note of its elements and then evaluate each of them using the complete guide. Type your answers in the succeeding box. (20 Points)The City Mouse and the Country MouseOnce a little mouse who lived in the country invited a little Mouse from the city to visit him. When the little City Mouse sat down to dinner he was surprised to find that the Country Mouse had nothing to eat except barley and grain.“Really,” he said, “you do not live well at all; you should see how I live! I have all sorts of fine things to eat every day. You must come to visit me and see how nice it is to live in the city.”The little Country Mouse was glad to do this, and after a while he went to the city to visit his friend.The very first place that the City Mouse took the Country Mouse to see was the kitchen cupboard of the house where he lived. There, on the lowest shelf, behind some stone jars, stood a big paper bag of brown sugar. The little City Mouse gnawed a hole in the bag and invited his friend to nibble for himself.The two little mice nibbled and nibbled, and the Country Mouse thought he had never tasted anything so delicious in his life. He was just thinking how lucky the City Mouse was, when suddenly the door opened with a bang, and in came the cook to get some flour.“Run!” whispered the City Mouse. And they ran as fast as they could to the little hole where they had come in. The little Country Mouse was shaking all over when they got safely away, but the little City Mouse said, “That is nothing; she will soon go away and then we can go back.”After the cook had gone away and shut the door they stole softly back, and this time the City Mouse had something new to show: he took the little Country Mouse into a corner on the top shelf, where a big jar of dried prunes stood open. After much tugging and pulling they got a large dried prune out of the jar on to the shelf and began to nibble at it. This was even better than the brown sugar. The little Country Mouse liked the taste so much that he could hardly nibble fast enough. But all at once, in the midst of their eating, there came a scratching at the door and a sharp, loud MIAOUW!“What is that?” said the Country Mouse. The City Mouse just whispered, “Sh!” and ran as fast as he could to the hole.The Country Mouse ran after, you may be sure, as fast as HE could. As soon as they were out of danger the City Mouse said, “That was the old Cat; she is the best mouser in town,–if she once gets you, you are lost.”“This is very terrible,” said the little Country Mouse; “let us not go back to the cupboard again.”“No,” said the City Mouse, “I will take you to the cellar; there is something especial there.”So the City Mouse took his little friend down the cellar stairs and into a big cupboard where there were many shelves. On the shelves were jars of butter, and cheeses in bags and out of bags. Overhead hung bunches of sausages, and there were spicy apples in barrels standing about. It smelled so good that it went to the little Country Mouse’s head. He ran along the shelf and nibbled at a cheese here, and a bit of butter there, until he saw an especially rich, very delicious-smelling piece of cheese on a queer little stand in a corner. He was just on the point of putting his teeth into the cheese when the City Mouse saw him.“Stop! stop!” cried the City Mouse. “That is a trap!”The little Country Mouse stopped and said, “What is a trap?”“That thing is a trap,” said the little City Mouse. “The minute you touch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head hard, and you’re dead.”The little Country Mouse looked at the trap, and he looked at the cheese, and he looked at the little City Mouse. “If you’ll excuse me,” he said, “I think I will go home. I’d rather have barley and grain to eat and eat it in peace and comfort, than have brown sugar and dried prunes and cheese,–and be frightened to death all the time!”So the little Country Mouse went back to his home, and there he stayed all the rest of his life.https://bygosh.com/kids-classics/the-city-mouse-and-the-country-mouse/#Break your PLOT of the story into three parts:1.

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

10. MANILA, Philippines—San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped theTropang Giga’s perfect six-game start to the conference. San Miguel Beer went on a 20-7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. “This is a big game for us and I’m thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there,” said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to4-2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.

(Need ASAP)1. Making a great cup of tea is easy if you follow these three steps. First, heat a cup of water to a boiling point. Then put the tea bag in the hot water, and let it seep into the hot water for atleast three minutes. Finally, add creamer and sugar to taste. There is nothing tastier than a strong cup of tea early in the morning. Pattern of Development:2. There are three types of family vehicles made in the United States. The first type is the minivan. All American car manufactures make a version of the minivan. Some say that the comfort and amenities of the minivan compare to none. The second type of family vehicle is the SUV. Some SUVs offer four wheel-drive to navigate tough terrains, and they also offer seating for a large crowd. A third type of family vehicles is called the "crossover". These vehicles supposedly have the best features of the sedan. mini-van, and SUV. They are easy to maneuver, look much like a regular sedan, and sit up to six people All of these vehicles are family friendly, they offer safety, roomy comfort, and many extra features to accommodate the special needs of families. Pattern of Development: 3. Although the twin brothers shared many physical characteristics, they handled themselves differently in social situations. Mario was a shy introverted young man. He had few friends and mostly kept to himself. On the other hand, Gino was outgoing and the life of the party. Unlike Mario Gino had many friends and felt totally at ease among big crowds. The best way to tell these identical twins apart is to invite both to a party and observe how differently they interact with the other guests. Pattern of Development: 4. There are many reasons why I enjoy walking tours when visiting new cities. For starters, walking through a city allows the visitor to see the details of an area without having to hurry. This often results in meeting locals and experiencing their lives and traditions first hand. Furthermore, walking tours are flexible and inexpensive because there are no strict schedules or transportation expenses. Travelers taking walking tours are rewarded with first hand experiences of the places they visit and the opportunity to personally interact with the people who live there. Pattern of Development: 5. The Washington Monument is divided into three main areas. The lowest section of the building houses the entrance, a gift shop, and a restaurant. The middle section consists of elevators and stairways to the top. The top section of the monument includes an observation deck with a spectacular view of the Washington DC area. When I visited the Washington Monument, I toured every section but enjoyed the spectacular 180 degree view the most.Pattern of Development:​</h2><br />

                        <p>Anxiety</p><p></p><p>I have a social anxiety, and to be honest the one week lock down a year ago made me feel good. I hate being with people and knowing that we are in a face to face set up, I have to interact with people and deal with them. As days goes by, everything feels like it's going through how I like it, the lockdown extended, it wasn't good but for me who has social anxiety, I couldn't feel any better, but as the lockdown extends, I started missing my life, my life outside my room, I missed my friends, the people around me, which is kind of weird, for I have a social anxiety. It was all bearable, not until the lockdown last for five months already, I started having breakdowns, I moved school, I have no one to talk to. That's when I realized that No man is an island, we need each other to survive, we need each other's presence. So I gathered up all my strength, and communicate with everyone I know, and as they reply, I felt my heart warm, and realized, if it wasn't for them, I won't really survive. </p><p></p><br />

Halo-halo yung mga emotion na naf-feel ko, minsan malungkot. Pero ang ginawa ko para hindi ko yun mafeel ay nag-dasal ako, at nang hingi nang tulong sa Panginoon. Ngayon, kahit may nararamdaman man akong kahirapan sa buhay, naf-feel ko na may kasama na ako upang labanan yun at ayon ay si God. Although, naf-feel ko rin na nahihirapan na ako sa buhay pero naaalala ko lagi ang Panginoon na hindi nya tayo papabayaan at gagabayan nya tayo. Kaya yung mga nakakaranas nang struggles ngayon, tandaan nyo wag kayo mawalan nang faith kay God laban lang nang laban! Wag susuko!
