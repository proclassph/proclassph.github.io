                                            If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

                                            One morning there was a loud knock at Dean Swift's door. The servant opened it.
A man handed her a fine duck and said, "Here's a present for the Dean. It's from Mr. Boyle." Without a word, he walked away. Mr. Boyle was a sporting neighbor and he was an admirer of Dean Swift. The next time, the man brought a quail. "Here's something else for the Dean," he said roughly, and tossed it into the servant's arms. "That fellow has no manners," she said."The next time he comes," said the Dean, "let me know, and I will go to the door." It was not long until the man came with a present. The Dean went to the door."Here's a rabbit from Mr. Boyle," said the man."See here," said the Dean in a stern voice, "that is not the way to deliver a message. Just step inside and make believe that you are Dean Swift. I will go out and make believe that I am bringing him a present." "I'l agree to that," said the man; and he stepped inside. The Dean took the rabbit and went out. Then he knocked gently at the door. The door was opened by the man. The Dean bowed and said, "If you please, sir, Mr. Boyle's compliments, and he wishes you to accept this fine rabbit." "Oh, thank you," said the man very politely. Then, he offered the Dean a shilling. "And here is something for your trouble." The lesson in manners was not forgotten; the man was always very polite when he brought his presents. And the Dean always gives the man a "tip" for his trouble. Jonathan Swift, often called Dean Swift, was famous as a writer. Among other books he wrote "Gulliver's Travels." Answer the questions,
1.Why was the messenger sent by Mr. Boyle? What presents did he deliver?
2.Why did the servant complain about the messenger?
3.What did Dean Swift do to teach the messenger about good manners?
4.What happened after the encounter between Dean Swift and the messenger?
5.What lesson did you learn from the story?
6.What are situations where you should show good manners?</a>

                                            Guess the song..
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me</a>

                            14. One morning there was a loud knock at Dean Swift's door. The servant opened it.
A man handed her a fine duck and said, "Here's a present for the Dean. It's from Mr. Boyle." Without a word, he walked away. Mr. Boyle was a sporting neighbor and he was an admirer of Dean Swift. The next time, the man brought a quail. "Here's something else for the Dean," he said roughly, and tossed it into the servant's arms. "That fellow has no manners," she said."The next time he comes," said the Dean, "let me know, and I will go to the door." It was not long until the man came with a present. The Dean went to the door."Here's a rabbit from Mr. Boyle," said the man."See here," said the Dean in a stern voice, "that is not the way to deliver a message. Just step inside and make believe that you are Dean Swift. I will go out and make believe that I am bringing him a present." "I'l agree to that," said the man; and he stepped inside. The Dean took the rabbit and went out. Then he knocked gently at the door. The door was opened by the man. The Dean bowed and said, "If you please, sir, Mr. Boyle's compliments, and he wishes you to accept this fine rabbit." "Oh, thank you," said the man very politely. Then, he offered the Dean a shilling. "And here is something for your trouble." The lesson in manners was not forgotten; the man was always very polite when he brought his presents. And the Dean always gives the man a "tip" for his trouble. Jonathan Swift, often called Dean Swift, was famous as a writer. Among other books he wrote "Gulliver's Travels." Answer the questions,
1.Why was the messenger sent by Mr. Boyle? What presents did he deliver?
2.Why did the servant complain about the messenger?
3.What did Dean Swift do to teach the messenger about good manners?
4.What happened after the encounter between Dean Swift and the messenger?
5.What lesson did you learn from the story?
6.What are situations where you should show good manners?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The messenger was sent by Mr. Boyle to deliver presents to Dean Swift. He delivered a duck, a quail, and a rabbit.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The servant complained about the messenger because he had no manners and delivered the presents roughly.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Dean Swift taught the messenger about good manners by having him come inside and pretend to be Dean Swift while he pretended to be the messenger delivering the present. He then showed him the proper way to deliver a message, bowing and saying "Mr. Boyle's compliments" and offering the present politely.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>After the encounter between Dean Swift and the messenger, the man was always polite when delivering presents and the Dean always gave him a "tip" for his trouble.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The lesson from the story is the importance of good manners and how a small lesson can make a big difference in someone's behavior.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Good manners are important in all situations, but especially when interacting with others in professional or social settings.

                            29. Guess the song..
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me</h2><br />
