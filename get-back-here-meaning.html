Browse the selection to fill in the problem-solution outline activity below.There once was a beautiful mango tree that grew in the jungle near a village. Each and every year when its fruit was in season, the children from the village would run into the jungle and harvest its delicious fruit. However, one day when the children went to the tree, they were surprised to find a fence encircling the popular tree. Inside the perimeter of the fence were two mean looking dogs that watched warily their every move. A stranger who the children had not seen before came out of the jungle and approached them. “Get out of here!” the stranger shouted. “This tree belongs to me now!” “No, it doesn't!” The children cried. “You don’t own the jungle! This tree belongs to everyone. Anyone can pick fruit from this tree!” The children were right. They were telling the truth, but the stranger paid no attention to them. He made his dogs chase the children who retreated to the village from whence they came. Upon returning, the children went immediately to the village headman. They told him about the stranger and about what happened. The village headman was very wise and very clever. After some time, he came up with an idea. She threw two morsels of meat to the dogs and climbed over the fence. She then took a mango from the tree and began eating. Again, the stranger ran over from the jungle and into the clearing. Stop!” He shouted. “You cannot take my mangoes! Go away!” Ignoring the stranger, the girl took another bite from the mango. Suddenly she screamed out loud and fell to the ground and lay still. At that moment, the headman came by and walked up to the stranger. “What have you done to this poor girl?” The headman asked him. “Nothing!” The stranger replied. “She took one of my mangoes and fell to the ground. "The headman knelt before the girl and felt her forehead. “I’m afraid she has mango sickness,” the headman said shaking his head. “You see, once every ten years, poisonous mangoes will grow from this tree. You must not eat any mangoes from this tree this year.” The headman then picked up the girl and carried her back to the village. the next morning, the children from the village followed the headman into the jungle to the mango tree. Looking around, they saw that the stranger was gone and took with him the fence along with his two fearsome dogs. Once again, the children began climbing up the mango tree to harvest its delicious fruit. When they returned to their village, the children laughed and sang songs in their happiness while carrying their mangoes.

12. The sun was beginning to set. Light rays pierced through the hills and I could see the stars awakening on the other side of the sky, but I did not want to go home. "Give me one more try. I'll get it this time," I pleaded with Jake. He tilted his head to the side, crinkled his face, and said, "Look, if you couldn't do it the last thousand times, you're probably not going to get it right now. Why don't you get your own skateboard, then you can work on your tricks all day and night?" He was right. I needed to get my own skateboard.

13. "You can't do it. You'll never do it," said my cousin Victor as I stood at the free-throw line. I turned around so that my back was to the hoop and began bending backward. I could now see the hoop, but it was upside down. I held the ball against my inverted chest. "Come on, you know you can't do it. Just take the letter," Victor continued goading me but I wasn't trying to hear that nonsense. I wound back and released the ball. It flew from my hands in a perfect arc and soared directly over the backboard. "I told you so," Victor said smugly.

14. Hank brushed the sweat and dirt from his brow. He looked carefully at the crystal mass. These rocks had formed over millions of years. They were beautiful, but they were in the way of the gold. Hank spooled the wire out about twenty feet from the crystal mass. He took cover behind a cave wall and ordered the men to move back before he hit the switch. Boom! Crystal fragments exploded outward and settled on the cave floor. "All clear!" Hank shouted.

                                            Time does not exist. It's an illusion. Time dilation is when time is distorted because of space. The faster you move in space, the slower you move in time and the faster you move in time, the slower you move in space.For example, if the train your riding is fast, it would take you less time to get to your destination, it means you will arrive there quicker because the train is moving fast. Another example is when you're walking or running. You move faster in space when you are running compared to when you are walking and therefore when you will run, you will arrive at your desired place much quicker than when you are walking. That's why when someone says "I will be in your house IN NO TIME" it means they will move quickly (maybe ride a car to your house instead of running) that time can't catch up with them (if you will ride a car, you would arrive in their house in 5 minutes but when you run, it will take you 30 minutes to get to their house).Same with outer space. We can say that a year has passed here on earth when it will complete it's orbit around the sun. Since the other planets are closer to the sun, they will complete their orbit faster than the earth. The farther they are to the sun, the more time it will take for them to orbit around the sun. So 1 year on Mercury is just 88 days on earth and 84 years on Uranus. 3 months palang dito sa earth, one year na sa mercury dahil mas malapit sila sa sun at sila yung mauunang maka complete ng kanilang orbit sa sun. Also, if you leave earth at the age of 15 at the speed of light and stay in outer space for 5 years, when you go back to earth you will be 20 years old but those who are 15 when you left will be 65 years old.Time does not exist. We only created time to organize our routines in life. But remember, If you really depend on time, it will be different depending on where you are right now.Do you agree with the statement above?

                                            plsss help meein ten sentences, summarize the short story below.The Prodigal Son (Bible Story)There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first son was hard working. He always obey his father.He was very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He didnot work in his father's field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a happy and free life.One day, the younger son said to his father. "Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad.He divided the property. The second son took his share of properly. He left home with his share. He went to a distantland. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his money lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many badhabits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him oneby oneAt that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food ormoney. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept forthe pige. He was very sad about his present condition. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He saidto himself. "In my father's house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I amstruggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father's house. In the meantime, his father was always thinkingof his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home.One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son onthe way. His son knelt down. He said, "Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant."His father lifted him lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, "Bring the best robe. Putit on my son. Put a ning on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted call. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy.My son was lost. Now he is found."The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from the house.He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told him, "Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at hisretum. A fatted call has been killed to prepare for a grand celebration."The first son was angry. He refused to enter the house. The father came out' He begged his elder son tocome in for rejoicing. The elder son said, "I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your works. But younever gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you ordered afatted call for him!"His father replied, "My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother wasdead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore should we not rejoice?"The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his youngerbrother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.​</a>

Let's Try However, one day when the children went to the tree, they were surprised to find a fence encircling the popular tree. Inside the perimeter of the fence were two mean looking dogs that watched warily their every move. A stranger who the children had not seen before came out of the jungle and approached them. "Get out of here!" the stranger shouted. "This tree belongs to me now!" "No, it doesn't!" The children cried. "You don't own the jungle! This tree belongs to everyone. Anyone can pick fruit from this tree!" The children were right. They were telling the truth, but the stranger paid no attention to them. He made his dogs chase the children who retreated to the village from whence they came. Upon returning, the children went immediately to the village headman. They told him about the stranger and about what happened. The village headman was very wise and very clever. After some time, he came up with an idea. PROBLEM WHO: WHAT: WHY: There once was a beautiful mango tree that grew in the jungle near a village. Each and every year when its fruit was in season, the children from the village would run into the jungle and harvest i delicious fruit. She threw two morsels of meat to the dogs and climbed over the fence. She then took a mango from the tree and began eating. Again, the stranger ran over from the jungle and into the clearing. Stop!" He shouted. "You cannot take my mangoes! Go away!" Ignoring the stranger, the girl took another bite from the mango. Suddenly she screamed out loud and fell to the ground and lay still. At that moment, the headman came by and walked up to the stranger. "What have you done to this poor girl?" The headman asked him. "Nothing!" The stranger replied. "She took one of my mangoes and fell to the ground." The headman knelt before the girl and felt her forehead. "I'm afraid she has mango sickness," the headman said shaking his head. "You see, once every ten years, poisonous mangoes will grow from this tree... You must not eat any mangoes from this tree this year." The headman then picked up the girl and carried her back to the picked up and village. The next morning, the children from the village followed the headman into the jungle to the mango tree. Looking around, they saw that the stranger was gone and took with him the fence along with his two fearsome dogs. Once again, the children began climbing up the mango tree to harvest its delicious fruit. When they returned to their village, the children laughed and sang songs in their happiness while carrying their mangoes. They shared their bounty with everyone.

                                            DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving Policeman says son you can't stay here
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
Repeat Chorus
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. I'm not moving, I'm not moving People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh whoa There are no holes in his shoes But a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved
Repeat Chorus 2x
Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move.

"The Story of the Disobedient Son"
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first so was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
At that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present conditions. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant." So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home.
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant." His father lifted his lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy. My son was lost. Now he is fount."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told his, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your works. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore, should we not rejoice?" The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.</a>

"DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? "Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016, they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of people with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invested in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot. of people to think twice before taking their first puff.Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age.To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there.As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their dangerous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day become more obvious to them too.INTRODUCTION•What is the issue about?•Background • Relevance•Thesis statementBODY•Argument•Counter-argument •Evidences presentedCONCLUSION •Restated position •Course of action presented​</a>

11. Violet pulled her hair back into a ponytail. She was stressed. For the third time this week, a teacher was going to call her home and she knew that she wouldn't be able to talk her way out of this one. She thought that she would try anyway. "Come on, Mr. Jones," she pleaded. "I didn't mean to do it. I just held out my hand and he ran into it." Mr. Jones smirked and replied, "Yeah, nice try, Violet, but here's the deal. When one of my students gets hurt, we call homes and that's it." Violet buried her face in her palms. *

I'll get it this time," I pleaded with Jake. He tilted his head to the side, crinkled his face, and said, "Look, if you couldn't do it the last thousand times, you're probably not going to get it right now. Why don't you get your own skateboard, then you can work on your tricks all day and night?" He was right. I needed to get my own skateboard. *

I could now see the hoop, but it was upside down. I held the ball against my inverted chest. "Come on, you know you can't do it. Just take the letter," Victor continued goading me but I wasn't trying to hear that nonsense. I wound back and released the ball. It flew from my hands in a perfect arc and soared directly over the backboard. "I told you so," Victor said smugly.

                                            The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

Greetings from Maldives! It is my second day here, and I hope for a fun adventure! Yesterday we went snorkeling and saw some sea turtles and coral reefs. I never expected the water to be that crystal clear! Too bad I can't bring any corals home. Today, we will go dolphin spotting at Cinnamon Hakurra and do some island hopping. How's your trip going? Can't wait to see you when we get back. I wish you were here. Miss you! We are here tonight to celebrate the achievements of Mr. Mario Angeles, who has been serving our company for the past 20 years. He is a hardworking man who never failed to give a smile as he sees everyone along the halls. He is a father who is never tired of supporting his two daughters’ and son’s dreams and is successful in doing so. Mr. Angeles does not fail to be optimistic if there are problems along the way and would always cheer us up when we need it. Put three large egg yolks and finely grated parmesan cheese into a bowl. Season it with pepper and mix it well with a fork. Leave it on the side. Then, cook pancetta and crushed garlic on a medium frying pan in medium-high heat. Once the oil is rendered, remove the garlic and add cooked spaghetti and toss it over the heat. Remove the pan from the heat and add a splash of pasta water, season it with pepper, and add the egg and cheese mixture made earlier. Toss it well and add more pasta water until it looks glossy. Serve it with more parmesan cheese and cracked pepper. The problem, however, is that in interpreting and understanding literary texts, the use of one literary term or theory to focus on sometimes bring out more questions and clarifications in the text that should be answered. The tendency now is to look for more answers by looking at another theory that will answer these unclear interpretations. Then it also brings more questions, and so on. This paper aims to prove that through the use of different literary theories and various literary terms, the literary text is explored to its full potential without disrespecting the text itself and at the same time it also brings out a better appreciation of the meaning of the text read.​</a>

Inside the perimeter of the fence were two mean looking dogs that watched warily their every move. A stranger who the children had not seen before came out of the jungle and approached them. “Get out of here!” the stranger shouted. “This tree belongs to me now!” “No, it doesn't!” The children cried. “You don’t own the jungle! This tree belongs to everyone. Anyone can pick fruit from this tree!”The children were right. They were telling the truth, but the stranger paid no attention to them. He made his dogs chase the children who retreated to the village from whence they came. Upon returning, the children went immediately to the village headman. They told him about the stranger and about what happened. The village headman was very wise and very clever. After some time, he came up with an ideaShe threw two morsels of meat to the dogs and climbed over the fence. She then took a mango from the tree and began eating. Again, the stranger ran over from the jungle and into the clearing.Stop!” He shouted. “You cannot take my mangoes! Go away!”Ignoring the stranger, the girl took another bite from the mango. Suddenly she screamed out loud and fell to the ground and lay still. At that moment, the headman came by and walked up to the stranger.“What have you done to this poor girl?” The headman asked him.“Nothing!” The stranger replied. “She took one of my mangoes and fell to the ground."The headman knelt before the girl and felt her forehead. “I’m afraid she has mango sickness,” the headman said shaking his head. “You see, once every ten years, poisonous mangoes will grow from this tree…You must not eat any mangoes from this tree this year.” The headman then picked up the girl and carried her back to the village.The next morning, the children from the village followed the headman into the jungle to the mango tree. Looking around, they saw that the stranger was gone and took with him the fence along with his two fearsome dogs.Once again, the children began climbing up the mango tree to harvest its delicious fruit. When they returned to their village, the children laughed and sang songs in their happiness while carrying their mangoes. They shared their bounty with everyone.**The question is on the picture all the way at the top**Pls answer it​</a>

                                            The Prodigal Son
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first son was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was a very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
AT that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present condition. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."
So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home. 
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant."
His father lifted him lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy ourselves. My son was lost. Now he is fond."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told him, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your work. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore should we not rejoice?"
The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.

12. The sun was beginning to set. Light rays pierced through the hills and I could see the stars awakening on the other side of the sky, but I did not want to go home. "Give me one more try. I'll get it this time," I pleaded with Jake. He tilted his head to the side, crinkled his face, and said, "Look, if you couldn't do it the last thousand times, you're probably not going to get it right now. Why don't you get your own skateboard, then you can work on your tricks all day and night?" He was right. I needed to get my own skateboard.

I could now see the hoop, but it was upside down. I held the ball against my inverted chest. "Come on, you know you can't do it. Just take the letter," Victor continued goading me but I wasn't trying to hear that nonsense. I wound back and released the ball. It flew from my hands in a perfect arc and soared directly over the backboard. "I told you so," Victor said smugly.

14. Hank brushed the sweat and dirt from his brow. He looked carefully at the crystal mass. These rocks had formed over millions of years. They were beautiful, but they were in the way of the gold. Hank spooled the wire out about twenty feet from the crystal mass. He took cover behind a cave wall and ordered the men to move back before he hit the switch. Boom! Crystal fragments exploded outward and settled on the cave floor. "All clear!" Hank shouted.

There once was a beautiful mango tree that grew in the jungle near a village. Each and every year when its fruit was in season, the children from the village would run into the jungle and harvest its delicious fruit. However, one day when the children went to the tree, they were surprised to find a fence encircling the popular tree. Inside the perimeter of the fence were two mean looking dogs that watched warily their every move. A stranger who the children had not seen before came out of the jungle and approached them. "Get out of here!" the stranger shouted. "This tree belongs to me now!" "No, it doesn't!" The children cried. "You don't own the jungle! This tree belongs to everyone. Anyone can pick fruit from this tree!" The children were right. They were telling the truth, but the stranger paid no attention to them. He made his dogs chase the children who retreated to the village from whence they came. Upon returning, the children went immediately to the village headman. They told him about the stranger and about what happened. The village headman was very wise and very clever. After some time, he came up with an idea. She threw two morsels of meat to the dogs and climbed over the fence. She then took a mango from the tree and began eating. Again, the stranger ran over from the jungle and into the clearing. Stop!" He shouted. "You cannot take my mangoes! Go away!" Ignoring the stranger, the girl took another bite from the mango. Suddenly she screamed out loud and fell to the ground and lay still. At that moment, the headman came by and walked up to the stranger. "What have you done to this poor girl?" The headman asked him. "Nothing!" The stranger replied. "She took one of my mangoes and fell to the ground." The headman knelt before the girl and felt her forehead. "I'm afraid she has mango sickness," the headman said shaking his head. "You see, once every ten years, poisonous mangoes will grow from this tree... You must not eat any mangoes from this tree this year." The headman then picked up the girl and carried her back to the village. The next morning, the children from the village followed the headman into the jungle to the mango tree. Looking around, they saw that the stranger was gone and took with him the fence along with his two fearsome dogs. Once again, the children began climbing up the mango tree to harvest its delicious fruit. When they returned to their village, the children laughed and sang songs in their happiness while carrying their mangoes. They shared their bounty with everyone.

                            9. Time does not exist. It's an illusion. Time dilation is when time is distorted because of space. The faster you move in space, the slower you move in time and the faster you move in time, the slower you move in space.For example, if the train your riding is fast, it would take you less time to get to your destination, it means you will arrive there quicker because the train is moving fast. Another example is when you're walking or running. You move faster in space when you are running compared to when you are walking and therefore when you will run, you will arrive at your desired place much quicker than when you are walking. That's why when someone says "I will be in your house IN NO TIME" it means they will move quickly (maybe ride a car to your house instead of running) that time can't catch up with them (if you will ride a car, you would arrive in their house in 5 minutes but when you run, it will take you 30 minutes to get to their house).Same with outer space. We can say that a year has passed here on earth when it will complete it's orbit around the sun. Since the other planets are closer to the sun, they will complete their orbit faster than the earth. The farther they are to the sun, the more time it will take for them to orbit around the sun. So 1 year on Mercury is just 88 days on earth and 84 years on Uranus. 3 months palang dito sa earth, one year na sa mercury dahil mas malapit sila sa sun at sila yung mauunang maka complete ng kanilang orbit sa sun. Also, if you leave earth at the age of 15 at the speed of light and stay in outer space for 5 years, when you go back to earth you will be 20 years old but those who are 15 when you left will be 65 years old.Time does not exist. We only created time to organize our routines in life. But remember, If you really depend on time, it will be different depending on where you are right now.Do you agree with the statement above? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>Yes, my dear self, I absolutely agree with you. Time does not exist. We only use it to organize our routines and activities we do in our life. It's manmade. If you will be more attentive and observe the world and the universe, time does not exist. It is dependent on the current place you are in. </p><p></p><p>If you are in a black hole, time and space switch place. If here on earth you can move in 3d space and can only move one direction in time which is forward, in a black hole you can move only on one direction in space but can move backward and forward in time. </p><p></p><p>There is already a future and a past and we are just yet to experience it. Everything is happening at the same time. Right now that you are reading this, the future is happening on another timeline and so is the past. Everything is just like a loop. If you move as fast as light, you can go to the future. If you can move faster than light, you can travel to the past. </p><br />

They all deserted him oneby oneAt that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food ormoney. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept forthe pige. He was very sad about his present condition. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He saidto himself. "In my father's house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I amstruggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father's house. In the meantime, his father was always thinkingof his second son. He would sit near the windows.

                            15. DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

Discourse
Directions: Read and understand the song. Then, answer the questions in the chart. (5 points)
Going back to the corner where I first saw you Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
Chorus:
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving Policeman says son you can't stay here
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
Repeat Chorus
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. I'm not moving, I'm not moving People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh whoa There are no holes in his shoes But a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved
Repeat Chorus 2x
Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move.

"The Story of the Disobedient Son"
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first so was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
At that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present conditions. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant." So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home.
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant." His father lifted his lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy. My son was lost. Now he is fount."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told his, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your works. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore, should we not rejoice?" The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are two main characters in the story "The Story of the Disobedient Son": the first son and the second son. The first son is described as hardworking, obedient, and a good and nice person. The second son, on the other hand, is described as lazy, disobedient, and wanting to lead a free and carefree life. The second son also has bad habits and wastes his money, leading him to become poor and take a job feeding pigs. In contrast, the first son is obedient and works hard, but becomes angry when he sees his father celebrating the return of the second son. The father is a loving and forgiving character who is always thinking of his second son and rejoices at his return. Overall, the first son is portrayed as responsible and dutiful, while the second son is portrayed as reckless and irresponsible.</p><br />

"Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years.

11. Violet pulled her hair back into a ponytail. She was stressed. For the third time this week, a teacher was going to call her home and she knew that she wouldn't be able to talk her way out of this one. She thought that she would try anyway. "Come on, Mr. Jones," she pleaded. "I didn't mean to do it. I just held out my hand and he ran into it." Mr. Jones smirked and replied, "Yeah, nice try, Violet, but here's the deal. When one of my students gets hurt, we call homes and that's it." Violet buried her face in her palms. *

12. The sun was beginning to set. Light rays pierced through the hills and I could see the stars awakening on the other side of the sky, but I did not want to go home. "Give me one more try. I'll get it this time," I pleaded with Jake. He tilted his head to the side, crinkled his face, and said, "Look, if you couldn't do it the last thousand times, you're probably not going to get it right now. Why don't you get your own skateboard, then you can work on your tricks all day and night?" He was right. I needed to get my own skateboard. *

13. "You can't do it. You'll never do it," said my cousin Victor as I stood at the free-throw line. I turned around so that my back was to the hoop and began bending backward. I could now see the hoop, but it was upside down. I held the ball against my inverted chest. "Come on, you know you can't do it. Just take the letter," Victor continued goading me but I wasn't trying to hear that nonsense. I wound back and released the ball. It flew from my hands in a perfect arc and soared directly over the backboard. "I told you so," Victor said smugly.

                            27. The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

                            28. Read the four types of text below and identify what makes one different from the other in terms of topic, purpose, intended audience, structure, tone, and language. Greetings from Maldives! It is my second day here, and I hope for a fun adventure! Yesterday we went snorkeling and saw some sea turtles and coral reefs. I never expected the water to be that crystal clear! Too bad I can't bring any corals home. Today, we will go dolphin spotting at Cinnamon Hakurra and do some island hopping. How's your trip going? Can't wait to see you when we get back. I wish you were here. Miss you! We are here tonight to celebrate the achievements of Mr. Mario Angeles, who has been serving our company for the past 20 years. He is a hardworking man who never failed to give a smile as he sees everyone along the halls. He is a father who is never tired of supporting his two daughters’ and son’s dreams and is successful in doing so. Mr. Angeles does not fail to be optimistic if there are problems along the way and would always cheer us up when we need it. Put three large egg yolks and finely grated parmesan cheese into a bowl. Season it with pepper and mix it well with a fork. Leave it on the side. Then, cook pancetta and crushed garlic on a medium frying pan in medium-high heat. Once the oil is rendered, remove the garlic and add cooked spaghetti and toss it over the heat. Remove the pan from the heat and add a splash of pasta water, season it with pepper, and add the egg and cheese mixture made earlier. Toss it well and add more pasta water until it looks glossy. Serve it with more parmesan cheese and cracked pepper. The problem, however, is that in interpreting and understanding literary texts, the use of one literary term or theory to focus on sometimes bring out more questions and clarifications in the text that should be answered. The tendency now is to look for more answers by looking at another theory that will answer these unclear interpretations. Then it also brings more questions, and so on. This paper aims to prove that through the use of different literary theories and various literary terms, the literary text is explored to its full potential without disrespecting the text itself and at the same time it also brings out a better appreciation of the meaning of the text read.​</h2><br />

                            29. Let’s Try Directions: Read the Folktale entitled the Mango Tree. Browse the selection to 
fill in the problem-solution outline activity below. There once was a beautiful mango tree that grew in the
 jungle near a village. Each and every year when its fruit was in season, the children from the village would run into the jungle and harvest its delicious fruit.However, one day when the children went to the tree, they were surprised to find a fence encircling the popular tree. Inside the perimeter of the fence were two mean looking dogs that watched warily their every move. A stranger who the children had not seen before came out of the jungle and approached them. “Get out of here!” the stranger shouted. “This tree belongs to me now!” “No, it doesn't!” The children cried. “You don’t own the jungle! This tree belongs to everyone. Anyone can pick fruit from this tree!”The children were right. They were telling the truth, but the stranger paid no attention to them. He made his dogs chase the children who retreated to the village from whence they came. Upon returning, the children went immediately to the village headman. They told him about the stranger and about what happened. The village headman was very wise and very clever. After some time, he came up with an ideaShe threw two morsels of meat to the dogs and climbed over the fence. She then took a mango from the tree and began eating. Again, the stranger ran over from the jungle and into the clearing.Stop!” He shouted. “You cannot take my mangoes! Go away!”Ignoring the stranger, the girl took another bite from the mango. Suddenly she screamed out loud and fell to the ground and lay still. At that moment, the headman came by and walked up to the stranger.“What have you done to this poor girl?” The headman asked him.“Nothing!” The stranger replied. “She took one of my mangoes and fell to the ground."The headman knelt before the girl and felt her forehead. “I’m afraid she has mango sickness,” the headman said shaking his head. “You see, once every ten years, poisonous mangoes will grow from this tree…You must not eat any mangoes from this tree this year.” The headman then picked up the girl and carried her back to the village.The next morning, the children from the village followed the headman into the jungle to the mango tree. Looking around, they saw that the stranger was gone and took with him the fence along with his two fearsome dogs.Once again, the children began climbing up the mango tree to harvest its delicious fruit. When they returned to their village, the children laughed and sang songs in their happiness while carrying their mangoes. They shared their bounty with everyone.**The question is on the picture all the way at the top**Pls answer it​</h2><br />

                            30. The Prodigal Son
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first son was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was a very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
AT that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present condition. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."
So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home. 
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant."
His father lifted him lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy ourselves. My son was lost. Now he is fond."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told him, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your work. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore should we not rejoice?"
The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.
