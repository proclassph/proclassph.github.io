                                            Instructions: Take a look at the critique excerpt. Discuss its characteristics (Is it formal? comprehensive? objective? oNo More Than A DreamYesterday I dreamed a remarkable dream;I was riding with a girl who was reading Blok.The little horse moved quietly. The wheels rustled.And tears fell. And a russet curl fluttered…And that was all my dream contained…But shaken by it, moved profoundly, All day, trembling with agitation, I kept thinkingOf the strange girl who had not forgotten Blok…The poem’s title, “No More Than a Dream,” appears to downplay the significance of the dream. Rather than deflating the reader’s interest, however, the title intensifies it. Dreams typically come across as impressionistic and fleeting. They seem disengaged from everyday reality, yet they are notoriously rich in meaning. The world “udivitel nyi” (remarkable, astonishing, amazing) in the opening line of the poem immediately signals that the narrator -dreamer has in fact experience something more than just a dream. The first quatrain consists of five seemingly disconnected dream frames or sequences. The image of a girl reading Blok, in the first frame is a cryptic one. Who is the girl? And what is the underlying significance of her reading Blok? The second, third, and fourth dream images suggest that the dreamer’s dream-memory of Blok is laden with nostalgic, indeed, sad and painful feelings. The positioning of I slezy kapali (and tears were falling) as an autonomous image has the effect of drawing everything animate and inanimate. – the narrator and girl, the horse, and the wheel into the vortex of an almost elegiac sadness and pain.  Yet as we shall note again, this mood of elegiac sadness is abruptly contradicted by the final image of the first quatrain, “and a russet curl fluttered,” and animated and cheerful one that not only links the girl reading Blok with Eros, but introduces a literary allusion of string importance to the poem’s interpretation. The dream has turned out to be more than just a dream, it is a revelation of the power of poetry, the power of the word, the power of memory in life and culture, the power of Blok.​</a>

Is it just the lack of one's source of living? Or is there more to it than just that? What are the news and articles pertaining to it trying to address? What are they trying to imply? What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered. Thus, the making of this essay has a major goal of fulfilling the thoughts, untiringly lingering in our minds about the true essence of "unemployment", its aspects, effects, how to cope with it, and more.​</a>

                                            Pat Mora's poem, "Echoes," vividly describes the meaning and mood of the poem by using sensory images. At the beginning of the poem it was talking about white wine and cool dresses which give you a feel of upperclass elegance. Yet when it went from the white wine to the white uniform it changed the class of the hostess and the maid. When it mentioned that the maid's smile wavered when the speaker started to talk to her, it showed the level of amazement that the maid felt. However, the end, when it talks about hearing the cruel comment of "just drop the cups and plates / on the grass," it gave the poem a feeling of darkness as the poem told how the speaker stood in silence which describes her contradicting feelings. Towards the end of the poem the roar and flash help the reader envision the speaker's rage for the cruelty that is being calmed in a racist society.

Write the answers on a separate sheet of paper. 1. Kindness is being generous with others, giving your time, money, and talent to support those who are in need. Performing random acts of kindness can help someone to see the good in the world. As you spread joy and happiness, you will help others experience the good during difficult times. 2. Exceptional people live with a sense of inner elegance and are graceful even amidst a challenge. They are able to handle themselves in a noble and ethical manner. They hold good posture, their energy has a mystery, softness, strength and cleverness to it. They are vulnerable yet self-assured. 3. Kindness is a genuine love and care for others. It is being compassionate, which means to really be there for someone, listening intently to their suffering or just sitting with them and silently supporting them. Such compassion involves a deep concern for the welfare of others. 4. Every time Dad goes to the grocery store, he does these acts of kindness consistently. He would add some items which he would give the old woman outside. Not only the old woman whom he made has eaten but the street children who pass by.​</a>

Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail. Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. There's so much to give yet so much to lose.​</a>

                                            Men's looks matter to heterosexual women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that a potential partner is healthy and parasite-free). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources which means a short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminist journalists deforest North America publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and "Learn to love that woman in the mirror!", nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to "Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch!" Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having the vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money like a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, "No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly!"

Then, he looked by the window and asked," Why can't I go outside and play?" "You can't play outside yet. COVID-19 disease is very harmful," mother warned him. "I don't understand why it is not safe to play outside. Could you please explain it to me?" Jose asked. "Jose, just pray that this COVID-19 disease will end so that you can go and play outside again," mother advised Jose. "Okay, Mama. Will you please tell me what COVID- 19 is?" Jose asked again. "COVID-19 means Corona Virus Disease 2019 which can cause difficulty in breathing. We need to stay at home as much as possible to be safe from this disease." mother explained. "Thanks Ma. Now, I understand it. I'll just stay at home so I won't get infected with the disease," Jose said. 2​</a>

These might be some of the crucial questions you have in your mind right now? Substances behave differently with other substances. Some may dissolve in water, others may not. Still, other molecules would boil faster than the others. These are just few of the many physical properties affected by the polarity of molecules. In Pharmacology, polarity is such an important factor to consider. Medicines must be soluble enough for our body to absorb the necessary substances. In the same manner, people are of various polarity as well. Some may get along pretty quick with one another, yet others find it a challenge. Other people can dominate and manipulate others, while the others might be submissive and tolerant. And how about bipolar personality? Have you heard anything about this?

                                            What does it mean to have a linear or bent shaped molecule? How would it aflect anything? What is the importance of knowing molecular shapes and polarity? These might be some of the cracial questions you have in your mind right now? Substances behave differently with other substances Some may dissolve in water, others may not. Still, other molecules would boil faster than the others. These are just few of the many physical properties affected by the polarity of molecules In Pharmacology, polarity is such an important factor to consider. Medicines must be soluble enough for our body to absorb the necessary substances O A Y in the same manner, people are of various polarity as well. Some may get along pretty quick with one another, yet others find it a challenge. Other people can date and manipulate others, while the others might be submissive and tolerant. And how about bipolar personality? Have you heard anything about this? What do you think should be understood from having a bipolar personality?​</a>

 Men's looks matter to straight women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features ( a sign that a potential partner is healthy and parasite-free ). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources- which means a really short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminists journalists deforest North American publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and " Learn to love that woman in the mirror! " nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to " Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch! "
 Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money as a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, " No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly! " ( Because the road to female empowerment is... looking just like a hairy old man? )
Please help, thank you!</a>

                            4. Instructions: Take a look at the critique excerpt. Discuss its characteristics (Is it formal? comprehensive? objective? oNo More Than A DreamYesterday I dreamed a remarkable dream;I was riding with a girl who was reading Blok.The little horse moved quietly. The wheels rustled.And tears fell. And a russet curl fluttered…And that was all my dream contained…But shaken by it, moved profoundly, All day, trembling with agitation, I kept thinkingOf the strange girl who had not forgotten Blok…The poem’s title, “No More Than a Dream,” appears to downplay the significance of the dream. Rather than deflating the reader’s interest, however, the title intensifies it. Dreams typically come across as impressionistic and fleeting. They seem disengaged from everyday reality, yet they are notoriously rich in meaning. The world “udivitel nyi” (remarkable, astonishing, amazing) in the opening line of the poem immediately signals that the narrator -dreamer has in fact experience something more than just a dream. The first quatrain consists of five seemingly disconnected dream frames or sequences. The image of a girl reading Blok, in the first frame is a cryptic one. Who is the girl? And what is the underlying significance of her reading Blok? The second, third, and fourth dream images suggest that the dreamer’s dream-memory of Blok is laden with nostalgic, indeed, sad and painful feelings. The positioning of I slezy kapali (and tears were falling) as an autonomous image has the effect of drawing everything animate and inanimate. – the narrator and girl, the horse, and the wheel into the vortex of an almost elegiac sadness and pain.  Yet as we shall note again, this mood of elegiac sadness is abruptly contradicted by the final image of the first quatrain, “and a russet curl fluttered,” and animated and cheerful one that not only links the girl reading Blok with Eros, but introduces a literary allusion of string importance to the poem’s interpretation. The dream has turned out to be more than just a dream, it is a revelation of the power of poetry, the power of the word, the power of memory in life and culture, the power of Blok.​</h2><br />

Indeed, how heartbreaking and devasting to only hear from the word "unemployment". But what more could it be when we learn further about it? What does "unemployment" really mean? Is it just the lack of one's source of living? Or is there more to it than just that? What are the news and articles pertaining to it trying to address? What are they trying to imply? What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered. Thus, the making of this essay has a major goal of fulfilling the thoughts, untiringly lingering in our minds about the true essence of "unemployment", its aspects, effects, how to cope with it, and more.​</h2><br />

                            10. Pat Mora's poem, "Echoes," vividly describes the meaning and mood of the poem by using sensory images. At the beginning of the poem it was talking about white wine and cool dresses which give you a feel of upperclass elegance. Yet when it went from the white wine to the white uniform it changed the class of the hostess and the maid. When it mentioned that the maid's smile wavered when the speaker started to talk to her, it showed the level of amazement that the maid felt. However, the end, when it talks about hearing the cruel comment of "just drop the cups and plates / on the grass," it gave the poem a feeling of darkness as the poem told how the speaker stood in silence which describes her contradicting feelings. Towards the end of the poem the roar and flash help the reader envision the speaker's rage for the cruelty that is being calmed in a racist society.

                            11. WHAT'S MORE Activity 5 Directions: Identify the topic sentence and the type of exemplification used in the following. Write the answers on a separate sheet of paper. 1. Kindness is being generous with others, giving your time, money, and talent to support those who are in need. Performing random acts of kindness can help someone to see the good in the world. As you spread joy and happiness, you will help others experience the good during difficult times. 2. Exceptional people live with a sense of inner elegance and are graceful even amidst a challenge. They are able to handle themselves in a noble and ethical manner. They hold good posture, their energy has a mystery, softness, strength and cleverness to it. They are vulnerable yet self-assured. 3. Kindness is a genuine love and care for others. It is being compassionate, which means to really be there for someone, listening intently to their suffering or just sitting with them and silently supporting them. Such compassion involves a deep concern for the welfare of others. 4. Every time Dad goes to the grocery store, he does these acts of kindness consistently. He would add some items which he would give the old woman outside. Not only the old woman whom he made has eaten but the street children who pass by.​</h2><br />

                            13. Directions. Read the following speech below. Then pick out the cohesive devices used in the statements. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life and some of which includes a snail. Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees then we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy, to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. Hence, we need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of .8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. There's so much to give yet so much to lose.​</h2><br />

                            14. Men's looks matter to heterosexual women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that a potential partner is healthy and parasite-free). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources which means a short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminist journalists deforest North America publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and "Learn to love that woman in the mirror!", nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to "Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch!" Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having the vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money like a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, "No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly!" (Because the road to female empowerment is...looking just like a hairy old man?)Please paki answer po kung anong ibig sabihin nito hindi ko talaga naintindihan.​</h2><br />

"I don't understand why it is not safe to play outside. Could you please explain it to me?" Jose asked. "Jose, just pray that this COVID-19 disease will end so that you can go and play outside again," mother advised Jose. "Okay, Mama. Will you please tell me what COVID- 19 is?" Jose asked again. "COVID-19 means Corona Virus Disease 2019 which can cause difficulty in breathing. We need to stay at home as much as possible to be safe from this disease." mother explained. "Thanks Ma. Now, I understand it. I'll just stay at home so I won't get infected with the disease," Jose said. 2​</h2><br />

                            18. What does it mean to have a linear or bent shaped molecule? How would it affect anything? What is the importance of knowing molecular shapes and polarity? These might be some of the crucial questions you have in your mind right now? Substances behave differently with other substances. Some may dissolve in water, others may not. Still, other molecules would boil faster than the others. These are just few of the many physical properties affected by the polarity of molecules. In Pharmacology, polarity is such an important factor to consider. Medicines must be soluble enough for our body to absorb the necessary substances. In the same manner, people are of various polarity as well. Some may get along pretty quick with one another, yet others find it a challenge. Other people can dominate and manipulate others, while the others might be submissive and tolerant. And how about bipolar personality? Have you heard anything about this?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What does it mean to have a linear or bent shaped molecule? </p><strong>Linear = is just a line of atoms with a 180° angle. Notice that it's 2 or 3 atoms total. Bent = Linear but bent due to the Lone Pairs that it contains, the more Lone Pairs the greater the bent and the smaller the degree.

These might be some of the cracial questions you have in your mind right now? Substances behave differently with other substances Some may dissolve in water, others may not.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A linear-shaped molecule is one in which the atoms or groups of atoms bonded to the central atom lie in a straight line. On the other hand, a bent or angular-shaped molecule is one in which the bonded atoms or groups of atoms are not in a straight line but form an angle. The shape of a molecule affects its physical and chemical properties. For example, the polarity of a molecule depends on its shape. A polar molecule has a dipole moment, which is the separation of charges across the molecule due to the unequal sharing of electrons. A nonpolar molecule has no dipole moment because the electrons are shared equally between the atoms.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The knowledge of molecular shapes and polarity is crucial in many fields of science, including chemistry, biology, and pharmacology. In chemistry, the shape and polarity of a molecule determine its reactivity and behavior in chemical reactions. In biology, the shape and polarity of molecules such as proteins and enzymes affect their function and interactions with other molecules. In pharmacology, the shape and polarity of a drug molecule determine its solubility, absorption, and effectiveness in treating diseases.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by episodes of extreme mood swings, including manic episodes (periods of high energy, racing thoughts, and reckless behavior) and depressive episodes (periods of low energy, sadness, and hopelessness). It is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and neurochemical factors. The term "bipolar" refers to the two opposite poles of mood swings that a person with this disorder experiences. Understanding bipolar disorder involves understanding the complex interactions between brain chemistry, genetics, and environmental factors.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            30. A. Read and comprehend the text below. Choose five sentences that show biases made by the author and provide a less biased statement for each chosen biases from the text.
 Men's looks matter to straight women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features ( a sign that a potential partner is healthy and parasite-free ). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources- which means a really short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminists journalists deforest North American publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and " Learn to love that woman in the mirror! " nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to " Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch! "
 Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money as a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, " No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly! " ( Because the road to female empowerment is... looking just like a hairy old man? )
Please help, thank you!</h2><br />
