                                            ** Additional Activities Activity 1.7 The compound interest that's being discussed on this module focuses only on the annual basis. It simply means that the interest of the money grows once a year or in a yearly basis. However, we all know that some investment institution compounded the interest more than once a year. Some are on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and semi-annually. Frequency of Conversion Daily Monthly Quarterly Semi-annually Description The interest is compounded everyday which is equal to 365 days in a year. The interest is compounded monthly which is equal to 12 months in a year. From the word "quarter" meaning 4, this means that the interest is compounded every 3 months in a year which is equal to 4 quarters. From the prefix semi-, this means that the interest is compounded twice a year. In Preparation for your next topic in your next module, research how to compute the compound interest if it is compounded more than once a year.​</a>

                            16. ** Additional Activities Activity 1.7 The compound interest that's being discussed on this module focuses only on the annual basis. It simply means that the interest of the money grows once a year or in a yearly basis. However, we all know that some investment institution compounded the interest more than once a year. Some are on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and semi-annually. Frequency of Conversion Daily Monthly Quarterly Semi-annually Description The interest is compounded everyday which is equal to 365 days in a year. The interest is compounded monthly which is equal to 12 months in a year. From the word "quarter" meaning 4, this means that the interest is compounded every 3 months in a year which is equal to 4 quarters. From the prefix semi-, this means that the interest is compounded twice a year. In Preparation for your next topic in your next module, research how to compute the compound interest if it is compounded more than once a year.​</h2><br />
                        <p>To calculate the compound interest on an investment that is compounded more than once per year, you can use the following formula:</p><p></p><p>A = P(1 + r/n)^nt</p><p></p><p>where A is the final amount of the investment, P is the initial principal or investment amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times per year that the interest is compounded, and t is the number of years the money is invested for.</p><p></p><p>For example, if you invest $1000 at an annual interest rate of 5% and the interest is compounded quarterly, then you would use the formula like this:</p><p></p><p>A = 1000(1 + 0.05/4)^4*1 = $1276.28</p><p></p><p>This means that after one year, your investment would be worth $1276.28.</p><p></p><p>You can also use this formula to calculate the effective annual interest rate, which is the rate of interest you would earn if the interest was compounded once per year. To do this, you would use the formula like this:</p><p></p><p>r_effective = (1 + r/n)^n - 1</p><p></p><p>For example, if you have an annual interest rate of 5% and the interest is compounded quarterly, then you would use the formula like this:</p><p></p><p>r_effective = (1 + 0.05/4)^4 - 1 = 0.051268</p><p></p><p>This means that the effective annual interest rate is 5.1268%.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We can use a one-sample t-test to determine if the increase in average tuition fee is statistically significant.
