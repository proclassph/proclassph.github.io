Directions: Read the dialogue. After reading, answer the given questions in your
activity notebook.
Mark: Who's that man coming?)
Leon: Mark! Good morning!
Mark: Oh! Good morning too Leon! I did not recognize you since you were
wearing a hat, goggles, gloves, mask, protective clothing and boots.
Leon: Can't you recognize me when I'm wearing these?
Mark: Yes. Anyway why are you wearing those?
Leon: I am supposed to spray Malathion insecticide since black bugs attack my
rice field so that I can have a good harvest. That is also the reason why I'm
wearing these things.
Mark. Not now Leonl Let the weather calm. Look! We have strong wind we are
in signal no. 1. Don't you remember our teacher told us when we were in Grade
7-Crop Production class that spraying during strong winds causes hazard.
Leon: Sorry Mark, I was absent during that time, thank you for reminding me.
For now, I will just go home and wait for the typhoon to stop before I will spray
my rice field.
Mark: Okay, your welcome Leon. God bless. Good bye!

He had tried his best to look for the other scouts but he failed. The sun was so bright and it wasextremely hot. He was very thirsty, tired and hungry. He looked for something to eat or drink but his backpackwas already empty. He uttered a short prayer while walking carefully. "Lord, I'm hungry and thirsty please give mesome food to eat and water to drink. Help me find my brother scouts."As the scout came close to a big tree, he saw something like a sack-filledwith something "God heard my prayers that's why he sent me food", thescout whispered. He hurriedly approached the sack and opened it with hisjungle knife. "Oh my!" the boy gasped. There were assorted fruits inside thesack. He ate some fruits and put the rest in his backpack. He continued walkinguntil he found his patrol resting and cheering near a brook. He happily joinedhis patrol and silently said, "Praise God because you .answered my prayersProcess Questions:1.

a. He wanted to be the master of all smiths.
b. "Won't you let me shoe him?" said our Lord. "You can try," said the smith. "You can't do it so badly that I can't fix it again."
c. The smith began to cut and break till he had taken off the horse's four legs. "For," he said, "I don't see why one should bother to take them off one y one."
d. "Oh, she won't be missed," answered the smith.
e. When St. Peter reminded the smith that he should have wished for God's grace and forgiveness, he answered, "I didn't dare ask for anything so great."</a>

                                            “Mrs. Linerode?” “Yes, I reply. What’s wrong?” It is 3:12am and I know this
isn’t good. This. Is. Not. Good. My stomach lurches. My head begins to spin. My husband’s nurse proceeds to tell me that James has taken a turn for the worse. My head swims as she tells me that the protocol is to place the patients on their stomachs for 16 hours per day to try to mitigate the collection of fluid within the lungs. “Pneumonia is a serious concern”, his nurse says. Pneumonia...isn’t this the precursor to the ventilator? My head rewinds as if in a movie to hear Governor Cuomo say that 80% of the patients on a ventilator never come off. Oh God. How is this happening? Our sons are on the way back to Syracuse with their families. I go back and forth between welcoming their visit and wanting to stay in bed and not get out of the covers. How is this happening? Why is this happening?
QUESTIONS:

The night before Jesus chose the twelve men who would be His apostles, He spent the entire night on a mountainside praying to the Father. He sought the wisdom and guidance of God first. I cringe to think about how often I’ve made big decisions without first taking enough time to seek God’s will and direction.

3-4. Jesus made prayer first priority. “While it was still dark” He got up early in 
The morning and found a quiet place to pray. When His disciples found Him praying, He announced it was time to go and preach in the villages and the synagogues because that was why He had come.” Jesus was preparing in prayer for the work the Father had laid before Him. .

 5-6. As Jesus taught and ministered and performed miracles, “the news about
Him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear Him” and be healed. Many of us might begin to think we were pretty great. Oh, Jesus knew who He was. But He also knew He came to point the way to the Father and to do it the Father’s way. So when all eyes were on Him, His eyes were on the Father. This passage tells us, “Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.

7-8. “He went up on a mountainside by Himself to pray.” Why then? Soaring on great spiritual highs like this opens the door for many potential crashes. Most of us have been there. Pride from our hand in the event. Disappointment when the “high” begins to level off. Perhaps Jesus recognized the need to stay grounded in order to keep moving ahead. But we should follow His example and go straight to God in the afterglow of a spiritual high.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ end here.
9-10. The night Jesus was betrayed and arrested He spent intensive time of prayer 
in the Garden. He even asked His closet friends to pray with Him. He knew the hours ahead would not be easy. He knew the pain would be great. So He went to the Father. He poured out all His emotions. He asked for what He wanted. Yet He submitted to the will of the Father. And the Father strengthened Him for the task ahead.

(Reference: STS MODULE)
Gerald Manley Hopkins wrote a poem in 1877, which he entitled God’s Grandeur. Read the poem and pay attention to the words that really made an impact on you.
The world is charged with the grandeur of God. It will flame out, like shining from shook foil; It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod? Generation have trod, have trod, have trod; And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil; And wear man’s smudge and shares man’s smell: the soil Is bare now, now can feet feel, being shod. And for all this, nature is never spent; There lives the dearest freshness deep down things; And though the last light off the black West went Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, spring— Because the holy Ghost over the bent World brood with warm breast and with ah! Bright wings.

I ran into a stranger as he passed by
"Oh excuse me, please" was my reply.
He said, "Please excuse me, too;
I wasn't even watching for you.
We went on our way and we said good-bye.
But at home a different story is told,
How we treat our loved ones, young and old.
Later that day, cooking the evening meal,
My daughter stood beside me very still.
When I turned around, I nearly knocked her down.
"Move out of my way," I said with a frown.
She walked away, her little heart broken.
I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken.
While I lay awake in bed,
The voice of God came to me and said,
"While dealing with a stranger, common courtesy you use,
But the children you love, you seem to abuse.
Look on the kitchen floor,
You'll find some flowers there by the door,
Those are the flowers she brought for you.
She picked them herself, pink, yellow, and blue.
She stood quietly not to spoil the surprise,
And you never saw the tears in her eyes."
By this time I felt very small,
And now my tears began to fall.
I quietly went and knelt by her bed;
"Wake up little girl, wake up," I said.
"Are these the flowers you picked for me?​
 knew you'd like them, especially the blue."
I said, "Daughter, I am sorry for the way I did today,
I shouldn't have shout at you that way."
She said, "Oh Mommy that's okay
And I do like the flowers, especially the blue."​

I used to hear mass everyday at the Cathedral and whenever we passed in our Mercedes benz 600 by those streets, I felt my self-suffocating with the smells and sights of those horrible people. Uff, such disgusting squatters’ people. I couldn’t hear the mass properly and I couldn’t pray because of them. MATIL: It’s not their fault, really.

                                            The Lazy Farmer? The rain gods had been smiling the whole night. The roads were muddy and the potholes were filled to the brim. It was the day for the market and Raju the farmer was riding his cart along the country road. He had to reach the market early so that he can sell his hay. It was very difficult for the horses to drag the load through the deep mud. On his journey suddenly the wheels of the horse cart sank into the mire. The more the horses pulled, the deeper the wheel sank. Raju climbed down from his seat and stood beside his cart. He searched all around but could not find anyone around to help him. Cursing his bad luck, he looked dejected and defeated. He didn't make the slightest effort to get down on the wheel and lift it up by himself. Instead, he started cursing his luck for what happened. Looking up at the sky, he started shouting at God, "I am so unlucky! Why has this happened to me? Oh God, come down to help me." After a long wait, God finally appeared before Raju. He asked Raju, "Do you think you can move the chariot by simply looking at it and whining about it? Nobody will help you unless you make some effort to help yourself. Did you try to get the wheel out of the pothole by yourself? Get up and put your shoulder to wheel and you will soon find the way out." Raju was ashamed of himself. He bent down and put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses. In no time the wheel was out of the mire. Raju learned his lesson. He thanked God and carried on his journey happily. Moral: God helps those who help themselves. Activity 1 Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Who is Raju? 3. Where did the story take place? 4. What problem did Raju meet? 5.

isn’t good. This. Is. Not. Good. My stomach lurches. My head begins to spin. My husband’s nurse proceeds to tell me that James has taken a turn for the worse. My head swims as she tells me that the protocol is to place the patients on their stomachs for 16 hours per day to try to mitigate the collection of fluid within the lungs. “Pneumonia is a serious concern”, his nurse says. Pneumonia...isn’t this the precursor to the ventilator? My head rewinds as if in a movie to hear Governor Cuomo say that 80% of the patients on a ventilator never come off. Oh God.

                            12. Analyze the given bible passages about the importance of prayer in the Jesus earthly ministry and relate it to your personal faith experiences.
The night before Jesus chose the twelve men who would be His apostles, He spent the entire night on a mountainside praying to the Father. He sought the wisdom and guidance of God first. I cringe to think about how often I’ve made big decisions without first taking enough time to seek God’s will and direction.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ end here.
3-4. Jesus made prayer first priority. “While it was still dark” He got up early in 
The morning and found a quiet place to pray. When His disciples found Him praying, He announced it was time to go and preach in the villages and the synagogues because that was why He had come.” Jesus was preparing in prayer for the work the Father had laid before Him. .
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ end here.
 5-6. As Jesus taught and ministered and performed miracles, “the news about
Him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear Him” and be healed. Many of us might begin to think we were pretty great. Oh, Jesus knew who He was. But He also knew He came to point the way to the Father and to do it the Father’s way. So when all eyes were on Him, His eyes were on the Father. This passage tells us, “Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ end here.
7-8. “He went up on a mountainside by Himself to pray.” Why then? Soaring on great spiritual highs like this opens the door for many potential crashes. Most of us have been there. Pride from our hand in the event. Disappointment when the “high” begins to level off. Perhaps Jesus recognized the need to stay grounded in order to keep moving ahead. But we should follow His example and go straight to God in the afterglow of a spiritual high.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ end here.
9-10. The night Jesus was betrayed and arrested He spent intensive time of prayer 
in the Garden. He even asked His closet friends to pray with Him. He knew the hours ahead would not be easy. He knew the pain would be great. So He went to the Father. He poured out all His emotions. He asked for what He wanted. Yet He submitted to the will of the Father. And the Father strengthened Him for the task ahead.

                            19. ACTIVITY 1: Read the poem below and analyze it. 
(Reference: STS MODULE)
Gerald Manley Hopkins wrote a poem in 1877, which he entitled God’s Grandeur. Read the poem and pay attention to the words that really made an impact on you.
The world is charged with the grandeur of God. It will flame out, like shining from shook foil; It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod? Generation have trod, have trod, have trod; And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil; And wear man’s smudge and shares man’s smell: the soil Is bare now, now can feet feel, being shod. And for all this, nature is never spent; There lives the dearest freshness deep down things; And though the last light off the black West went Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, spring— Because the holy Ghost over the bent World brood with warm breast and with ah! Bright wings.
Answer the following questions:
1. Is the poem related to the previous lesson? How? If it is not related, explain why.
2. What does the poem say about human ability to know and to create?
3. How is technology referred to in the poem? 
ACTIVTY 2: Read the application/assessment part of the module and answer the question below.
1. So, after having considered the excerpts from the Nicomachean Ethics, how is téchn? related to epist?m??</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Activity 1:1. The poem is not directly related to the previous lesson, which is not specified in the prompt. However, it can be related to the theme of the appreciation of nature, which is discussed in science and technology studies (STS).2. The poem suggests that human beings have lost touch with nature and are preoccupied with materialistic pursuits, such as trade and toil. However, despite this, the poem implies that there is still hope for humanity, as nature remains resilient and enduring. The poem does not directly address human ability to know and create.3. Technology is not directly referred to in the poem, but the negative impact of trade and toil on the environment can be interpreted as a critique of industrialization and modernization.Activity 2:1. The Greek words téchn? and epist?m? are related in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics in the sense that téchn? refers to practical knowledge or craft, while epist?m? refers to theoretical knowledge or science. The distinction between the two types of knowledge is important in Aristotle's philosophy, as they have different aims and methods. Téchn? aims at producing a product or achieving a goal, while epist?m? aims at understanding the nature and causes of things. However, both téchn? and epist?m? require phronesis, or practical wisdom, which enables one to use knowledge in a virtuous way. Thus, téchn? and epist?m? are related in the sense that they both require phronesis to be used properly.<strong>Explanation:</strong>MAKE ME BRANLISTCARRYING ON LEARNING<br />

                            20. Author Unknown
I ran into a stranger as he passed by
"Oh excuse me, please" was my reply.
He said, "Please excuse me, too;
I wasn't even watching for you.
We went on our way and we said good-bye.
But at home a different story is told,
How we treat our loved ones, young and old.
Later that day, cooking the evening meal,
My daughter stood beside me very still.
When I turned around, I nearly knocked her down.
"Move out of my way," I said with a frown.
She walked away, her little heart broken.
I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken.
While I lay awake in bed,
The voice of God came to me and said,
"While dealing with a stranger, common courtesy you use,
But the children you love, you seem to abuse.
Look on the kitchen floor,
You'll find some flowers there by the door,
Those are the flowers she brought for you.
She picked them herself, pink, yellow, and blue.
She stood quietly not to spoil the surprise,
And you never saw the tears in her eyes."
By this time I felt very small,
And now my tears began to fall.
I quietly went and knelt by her bed;
"Wake up little girl, wake up," I said.
"Are these the flowers you picked for me?​
 knew you'd like them, especially the blue."
I said, "Daughter, I am sorry for the way I did today,
I shouldn't have shout at you that way."
She said, "Oh Mommy that's okay
And I do like the flowers, especially the blue."​
Answer the following questions based on the poem.
1. Why did the mother yell at her daughter?
2. Mother has a different attitude toward her family and the stranger whom she
met. Why do you think she was different in treating people?
3. Have you experienced the same situation as the daughter in the poem? How did you react?
4. How would you explain these lines from the poem: "While dealing with a
stranger, common courtesy you use, but the children you love, you seem to @bus€d?
5. How would you define family, based on your understanding of the poem</h2><br />

FLOR: Well now, just how did you want me to collaborate—er—help? MATIL: It’s a benefit show we are holding to collect funds for the Sapang Palay people. You know the place? FLOR: (With a gesture of disgust). Uff, yes. Those squatters who were formerly in Intramuros. Thank God they are evicted. Can you imagine? I used to hear mass everyday at the Cathedral and whenever we passed in our Mercedes benz 600 by those streets, I felt my self-suffocating with the smells and sights of those horrible people. Uff, such disgusting squatters’ people. I couldn’t hear the mass properly and I couldn’t pray because of them. MATIL: It’s not their fault, really. After the war thousands came from the province and didn’t know where to settle.• Briefly answer the following questions:1. What do you notice in the script? 2.

                            24. The Lazy Farmer? The rain gods had been smiling the whole night. The roads were muddy and the potholes were filled to the brim. It was the day for the market and Raju the farmer was riding his cart along the country road. He had to reach the market early so that he can sell his hay. It was very difficult for the horses to drag the load through the deep mud. On his journey suddenly the wheels of the horse cart sank into the mire. The more the horses pulled, the deeper the wheel sank. Raju climbed down from his seat and stood beside his cart. He searched all around but could not find anyone around to help him. Cursing his bad luck, he looked dejected and defeated. He didn't make the slightest effort to get down on the wheel and lift it up by himself. Instead, he started cursing his luck for what happened. Looking up at the sky, he started shouting at God, "I am so unlucky! Why has this happened to me? Oh God, come down to help me." After a long wait, God finally appeared before Raju. He asked Raju, "Do you think you can move the chariot by simply looking at it and whining about it? Nobody will help you unless you make some effort to help yourself. Did you try to get the wheel out of the pothole by yourself? Get up and put your shoulder to wheel and you will soon find the way out." Raju was ashamed of himself. He bent down and put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses. In no time the wheel was out of the mire. Raju learned his lesson. He thanked God and carried on his journey happily. Moral: God helps those who help themselves. Activity 1 Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Who is Raju? 3. Where did the story take place? 4. What problem did Raju meet? 5.

                            27. One peaceful night, he dreamed of a monster named Covido. It was a virus that could harm a person whom he touched and talked with. "Oh, please don't come near me. I promise I will be a good child and I will obey my parents." Dodong was trembling and crying out of nervousness. He was searching for the alcohol to let the monster away from him. Unluckily, he could not find the alcohol or sanitizer. Covido was coming near him trying to reach and hug him. Suddenly, when Dodong opened his eyes and wiped his sweat in his forehead, he just realized that he was just dreaming. This time, he did the sign of the cross and prayed. He thanked God for keeping him and his family safe during this pandemic. Then, he promised that he will follow his parent's advice in observing and following the protocol to stop the spreading of COVID 19. Let us answer the questions, if you truly understood the story. 1.
