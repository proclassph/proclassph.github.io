                                            Could you explain this poem
My Love for Mother Nature	
I love the sound of the humming bird so early in the morning
I love the sound of the rain splashing through the bare land
I love the smell of the flowers and the taste of the yummy fruits
I love the feeling when air is passing to me and the wind is blowing through the trees
I love the view of the ocean and the sound of waves upon the sand
I love the texture of the seashells and how do they look in my hand
And when the sun is gone , I love the full moon that shines so bright in the midnight
I love the sounds of the crickets and other creatures of the night
So when I lay down to sleep , I thank the lord above
For all the things of nature and more all the things that I love</a>

One day it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love. Love was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, “Richness, can you take me with you?” Richness answered, “No, I can’t. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.” Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. “Vanity, please help me!” “I can’t help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat,” Vanity answered. Sadness also passed close by, so Love asked, “Sadness, let me go with you.” “Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!” Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice, “Come, Love, I will take you.” It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went his own way. Realizing how much she owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, “Who helped me?” “It was Time,” Knowledge answered. “Time?” asked Love. “But why did Time help me?” Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, “Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is.”Spot adjectives as many as you can​</a>

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 a.m. and I'm cursing your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

One day, it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love. Love was the only who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. (2.) Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, "Richness, can you take me with you?' Richness answered, "No, I can't. there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place for you here." (3.) Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. "Vanity, please help me.!" I can't help you Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered. (4.) Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, let me go with you." "Oh... Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!" (5.) Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice. "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. Wh they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed elder, Love asked knowledge, another elder, "Who helped me?" "It was Time," know ne help me?"​</a>

My Love for Mother Nature	
I love the sound of the humming bird so early in the morning
I love the sound of the rain splashing through the bare land
I love the smell of the flowers and the taste of the yummy fruits
I love the feeling when air is passing to me and the wind is blowing through the trees
I love the view of the ocean and the sound of waves upon the sand
I love the texture of the seashells and how do they look in my hand
And when the sun is gone , I love the full moon that shines so bright in the midnight
I love the sounds of the crickets and other creatures of the night
So when I lay down to sleep , I thank the lord above
For all the things of nature and more all the things that I love</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The persona is talking or more like describing what he can see or observe with our nature. At the last part of the poem, he is thanking God for making this world full of beauty.</strong></p><br />

                            20. And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 a.m. and I'm cursing your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

                            30. Love and Time (1.)Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness. Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day, it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love. Love was the only who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. (2.) Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, "Richness, can you take me with you?' Richness answered, "No, I can't. there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place for you here." (3.) Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. "Vanity, please help me.!" I can't help you Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered. (4.) Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, let me go with you." "Oh... Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!" (5.) Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice. "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. Wh they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed elder, Love asked knowledge, another elder, "Who helped me?" "It was Time," know ne help me?"​</h2><br />
