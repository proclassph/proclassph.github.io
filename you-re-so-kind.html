At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders. Then, with tears in his eyes and pain in his heart, he saidgoodbyeThe old mother gave a last piece of advice to her son. Her voice wastrembling with unselfish love. She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain. The weight seemed light to him now and he was able to makeit through the shadows and the moonlight down to their little hut. Underthe kitchen floor was a hidden basement where food was stored Theson hid his mother in there. He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order. This one was extremely unreasonable Hewanted his people to give him a gift of a rope made of ashesEveryone was in fear. The order had to be obeyed, yet no one in allof Shining knew how to make a rope of ashes. Then, one night, the sontold his mother about the new order from the ruler. Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time. Finally, helifted his head and said, "Shining needs more than strength and youthI forgot the old saying.

                                            what is the summary of The Aged Mother?eto yung storyLong, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy.Shining was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.Just at sundown, when his day’s work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and he cooked, dried it, and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow road was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they lost and confues, but he gave no heed. One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward -- ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the “abandoning of the aged.”The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain’s many paths and his return might be one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that as they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen pine needles, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifted his old mother onto it. Hew rapped her padded coat more closely about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart he said farewell.The trembling mother’s voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. “Let not thine eyes be blinded, my son.” She said. “The mountain road is full of dangers. LOOK carefully and follow the path which holds the piles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar path farther down.” The son’s surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart broke within and bowing to the ground, he cried aloud: “oh, Honorable mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I will not leave you. Together we will follow the path of twigs, and together we will die!”Once more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed now) and hastened down the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the valley. Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was covered and hidden from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her with everything she needed, continually watching and fearing she would be discovered. Time passed, and he was beginning to feel safe when again the governor sent forth heralds bearing an unreasonable order, seemingly as a boast of his power. His demand was that his subjects should present him with a rope of ashes.The entire province trembled with dread. The order must be obeyed yet who in all Shining could make a rope of ashes? One night, in great distress, the son whispered the news to his hidden mother. “Wait!” she said. “I will think. I will think” On the second day she told him what to do. “Make rope of twisted straw,” she said. “Then stretch it upon a row of flat stones and burn it on a windless night.” He called the people together and did as she said and when the blaze died down, there upon the stones, with every twist and fiber showing perfectly, lay a rope of ashes.The governor was pleased at the wit of the youth and praised greatly, but he demanded to know where he had obtained his wisdom. “Alas! Alas!” cried the farmer, “the truth must be told!” and with deep bows he related his story. The governor listened and then meditated in silence. Finally he lifted his head. “Shining needs more than strength of youth,” he said gravely. “Ah, that I should have forgotten the well-known saying, “with the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom!” That very hour the cruel law was abolished, and custom drifted into as far a past that only legend.​</a>

Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.    When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era.     Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living.

The poor farmer who lived at the bottom of themountain was very upset He dearly loved his mother and the orderof the wicked ruler. So, he tried to find the kindest way to put his mothercaused him great pain. But no one had ever dared to disobey the orderunwhitened rice. This was the main food for people like him and hisAt the end of the day, with his work completed, the farmer took somemother. He cooked it, dried it, and tied it up in a square cloth. He thenswung it in a bundle over his shoulder, along with a pitcher filled withto deathcool water. Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders. Then, with tears in his eyes and pain in his heart, he saidgoodbyeThe old mother gave a last piece of advice to her son. Her voice wastrembling with unselfish love. She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain. The weight seemed light to him now and he was able to makeit through the shadows and the moonlight down to their little hut.

He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order. This one was extremely unreasonable Hewanted his people to give him a gift of a rope made of ashesEveryone was in fear. The order had to be obeyed, yet no one in allof Shining knew how to make a rope of ashes. Then, one night, the sontold his mother about the new order from the ruler. Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from.

                            9. what is the summary of The Aged Mother?eto yung storyLong, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy.Shining was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.Just at sundown, when his day’s work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and he cooked, dried it, and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow road was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they lost and confues, but he gave no heed. One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward -- ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the “abandoning of the aged.”The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain’s many paths and his return might be one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that as they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen pine needles, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifted his old mother onto it. Hew rapped her padded coat more closely about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart he said farewell.The trembling mother’s voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. “Let not thine eyes be blinded, my son.” She said. “The mountain road is full of dangers. LOOK carefully and follow the path which holds the piles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar path farther down.” The son’s surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart broke within and bowing to the ground, he cried aloud: “oh, Honorable mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I will not leave you. Together we will follow the path of twigs, and together we will die!”Once more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed now) and hastened down the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the valley. Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was covered and hidden from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her with everything she needed, continually watching and fearing she would be discovered. Time passed, and he was beginning to feel safe when again the governor sent forth heralds bearing an unreasonable order, seemingly as a boast of his power. His demand was that his subjects should present him with a rope of ashes.The entire province trembled with dread. The order must be obeyed yet who in all Shining could make a rope of ashes? One night, in great distress, the son whispered the news to his hidden mother. “Wait!” she said. “I will think. I will think” On the second day she told him what to do. “Make rope of twisted straw,” she said. “Then stretch it upon a row of flat stones and burn it on a windless night.” He called the people together and did as she said and when the blaze died down, there upon the stones, with every twist and fiber showing perfectly, lay a rope of ashes.The governor was pleased at the wit of the youth and praised greatly, but he demanded to know where he had obtained his wisdom. “Alas! Alas!” cried the farmer, “the truth must be told!” and with deep bows he related his story. The governor listened and then meditated in silence. Finally he lifted his head. “Shining needs more than strength of youth,” he said gravely. “Ah, that I should have forgotten the well-known saying, “with the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom!” That very hour the cruel law was abolished, and custom drifted into as far a past that only legend.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"The Aged Mother" is a Japanese folktale about a cruel ruler who issues a decree that all old people must be put to death. A farmer and his mother try to escape the decree by fleeing to a distant mountain, where they meet an old woman who helps them. The old woman reveals that she is the spirit of the mountain and gives the farmer a magic paddle that will make him invisible. The farmer uses the paddle to return to his village and save the other elderly people by convincing the ruler to rescind his decree. The story highlights the importance of respecting and caring for the elderly, and the wisdom and guidance they can offer.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story is about a poor farmer and his aged mother who lived in a province ruled by a despotic leader. The governor ordered the immediate death of all aged people, which filled the farmer's heart with sorrow as he loved his mother with tender reverence. He decided to carry his helpless old mother to the summit of the mountain of the “abandoning of the aged” where he was supposed to leave her to die. However, the mother dropped twigs along the way to guide her son back down the mountain. The son decided to take his mother back with him and hide her beneath the kitchen floor of their hut. Later, when the governor demanded a rope of ashes, the son sought his mother's help who advised him to make a rope of twisted straw and burn it on a windless night. When the governor discovered the truth behind the son's wisdom, he abolished the cruel law of abandoning the aged.</p><br />

It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.    When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era.     Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm.

These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living.
