                                            I am a student of the National University in Manila. I was only in my first year.
As a student I have an observed appreciation of virtue (CORE
VALUES) Like Respect for the elderly when you say "Po and OOpo" respect for each other
classmate's decision Respect for school law. As a nationalian I was
trustworthy such as not cheating on exams Telling the truth and being diligent.
Because I see other N.U. students cleaning outside the University. As a
student, it's not easy either because you have to pass a lot of exams
memorize and study so that you can pass every science. I see the unity of each
National because in one class there are different courses such as Marketing, HRM and others
pa. You can see in them that they get along well with every project of our school. I remember
when I was new to this school I got lost and asked my neighbor
student where my classroom immediately he immediately accompanied me to my room and me
thanked him.Even if there is leftovers in a room it doesn’t disappear like that
I witnessed I saw a cellphone charged in the room I did not move it
so did my classmates because they knew they didn’t return it immediately by the owner and
thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight
I know there are still such people in the world because most people today can be exploited. .
My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without
we have deep knowledge or lessons I learn a lot as a good student.
I believe that youth is the hope of the people. I can make it through
study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair
every test as a student many people will actually pull you down but confident
only self is needed, diligence, Perseverance and never forget the faith in us
Dear Lord he will help us and
will guide. The year is fast approaching now let's just strive as a good and
diligent students we will not realize that we will be able to finish school and
one day we will succeed in the life we ​​face.

If a person can choose to do an action and otherwise determined,then the action is caused by not casually determined.3.Having the capacity to choose implies that one can be responsible for the consequences of his actions.4. Analytical tradition is an important tool toward freedom and truth.5.Discipline and responsibility should be taught especially through education.6. According to determinism human choices and actions are like all other events in the universe,in so far as a cause that is ultimately outside of nature (for example,God or fate)and therefore cannot be affected by human behavior.7. Positive freedom is freedom from fear of being attacked.8. For Skinner,holding someone responsible for an action means reinforcing desirable behavior-not as a reward for past actions but to cause someone to act and desirable ways in the future .9. Human behavior can be explained in terms of either that causes of actions or why the action is done.10. We must consider what the environment this to an organism not only before but also after in responds.​</a>

thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight

My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without

study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair
