WORD Pregnancy Morning Sickness Complications Discomfort Braxton Hicks Contraction Health Condition Trimester After marriage, a couple's desire is to build a family. Humans are reproduced through sexual reproduction. In this kind of reproduction, the man and woman's reproductive cells unite to make a new human cell and this process was called fertilization. Fertilization is a reproductive process where the genes of the father and mother merge to form a single cell; the new cell divides, then forms more cells. The ball of cells enters the uterus and attaches itself to the uterine wall. It is where the developing cells were attached and is called implantation. Pregnancy is the time when a new cell is formed during fertilization, grows, and develops into a baby in the woman's uterus. From the time that the ovum and the sperm cell unite until the end of the eight weeks, the developing human are called embryo. From the eight weeks until birth, the developing human is called the fetus. A normal pregnancy lasts until 38-40 weeks or 9 months.​</a>

WORD Pregnancy Morning Sickness Complications Discomfort Braxton Hicks Contraction Health Condition Trimester After marriage, a couple's desire is to build a family. Humans are reproduced through sexual reproduction. In this kind of reproduction, the man and woman's reproductive cells unite to make a new human cell and this process was called fertilization. Fertilization is a reproductive process where the genes of the father and mother merge to form a single cell; the new cell divides, then forms more cells. The ball of cells enters the uterus and attaches itself to the uterine wall. It is where the developing cells were attached and is called implantation. Pregnancy is the time when a new cell is formed during fertilization, grows, and develops into a baby in the woman's uterus. From the time that the ovum and the sperm cell unite until the end of the eight weeks, the developing human are called embryo. From the eight weeks until birth, the developing human is called the fetus. A normal pregnancy lasts until 38-40 weeks or 9 months.​</h2><br />
