 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

 adapted from The Star and the Lily
 by Hamilton Wright Mabie
 At night the people met on the wide green—the ah-nung-o-kah—and watched the stars. One night they saw a star that shone brighter than all others, its location seemingly far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, until it was doubted by many that the star was as distant as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away. Warriors were sent to see what it was, and upon their return they said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird. A committee was called at once to ascertain the meaning of the unusual phenomenon.
 By the time one moon had gone by, the mystery still remained unsolved. Then, one night a young warrior had a dream in which the star came and stood at his side, and said, "Young brave, I have come to dwell among you!" Then, the young man awoke, but on stepping out of his lodge he saw the star still in its accustomed place. At early dawn, every warrior was called to the council lodge. When all were gathered, the young warrior related his dream, and the council concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and wanted to live among them. So, the next night, five braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth and as they returned to the village, the star, with expanded wings, followed and hovered till the dawn of day.</a>

DIRECTIONS: Read the story below then answer the questions that follow.THE FIRST RAINBOW	One day, Bathala planned a journey to Earth to visit his faithful followers. He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.

                                            Instruction: Congratulations for making it this far! You’re almost done. Before you proceed to your next lesson, let us test your mastery. Today’s task is to read the following paragraphs and determine which pattern of development in writing is used. Are you ready? Here are the paragraphs. 1. Caring for yourself during these times is also caring for others. When we are allowed to go outside our houses, we should obey health practices. Some are skeptic about wearing masks. Others are still in doubt when asked to wash hands often or use alcohol and sanitizer. There are also people who question the need to maintain distance from each other in public areas. These safety measures are set because they are proven to be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus. They are not mere wishes to make our lives difficult. We are asked to do these health protocols because we are still in danger with the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Be responsible for yourself so that you will not be the reason for others to catch the virus. If you care for your loved ones, you must take care of yourself first. You do not want to be the one bringing the virus to your home. 2. The word quarantine is such a familiar one to almost everyone who are aware of the pandemic today. According to the Merriam- Webster dictionary online, it is a noun that has several meanings. It states that it is a period of 40 days. It may also be a term during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore. Also, it means a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or the transport of goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is also defined as a state of enforced isolation. For us, who have been in community quarantine for more or less three months, we know that quarantine means staying at home and waiting for the situation to be better. It is a condition wherein only those who have quarantine pass are allowed to go out for essential needs of the family. For others, the concept quarantine may also be equated to “no work, no pay” policy. Some may define it as something needed for people who are sick or those who came from places with COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, some probably sees quarantine as something that takes away their right to see family, relatives and friends. To sum it up, whatever or however we understand quarantine, we need to follow it as a safety protocol since we are still fighting this pandemic. 3. There are several similarities and differences between being a senior and junior high school student. Being a senior and junior high school student, both require you to study hard to be able to get desirable outputs and decent grades. Subjects are equally important to be given attention. It’s just that some subject areas may be easier to deal with depending on different factors. The subjects in senior high school (SHS) and junior high school (JHS) differ in a way that SHS subjects are more specific areas that are deemed essential for the track and strand you chose while in JHS, subjects are the general ones that we have since first grade, just increasing in complexity. Another similarity is that when you enter SHS and JHS, you have to prepare yourself to be a responsible part of the institution that you will enroll in. You should be ready to follow the policy that the school implements. Being a “senior” high student doesn’t mean you are superior or anything and being a “junior” high student doesn’t mean that you are under those in the SHS. The difference comes when there may be slight changes in the way rules and regulations are applied and the gravity of reprimands you may receive as you step up to higher grade levels or as you encounter different situations. In general, whether there are similarity or difference in being a Senior or Junior high school student, it’s is still up to you how you will handle it.​</a>

 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

                            15. Which three pieces of evidence support the idea that the people do not know what the star is?
 adapted from The Star and the Lily
 by Hamilton Wright Mabie
 At night the people met on the wide green—the ah-nung-o-kah—and watched the stars. One night they saw a star that shone brighter than all others, its location seemingly far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, until it was doubted by many that the star was as distant as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away. Warriors were sent to see what it was, and upon their return they said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird. A committee was called at once to ascertain the meaning of the unusual phenomenon.
 By the time one moon had gone by, the mystery still remained unsolved. Then, one night a young warrior had a dream in which the star came and stood at his side, and said, "Young brave, I have come to dwell among you!" Then, the young man awoke, but on stepping out of his lodge he saw the star still in its accustomed place. At early dawn, every warrior was called to the council lodge. When all were gathered, the young warrior related his dream, and the council concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and wanted to live among them. So, the next night, five braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth and as they returned to the village, the star, with expanded wings, followed and hovered till the dawn of day.</h2><br />

DIRECTIONS: Read the story below then answer the questions that follow.THE FIRST RAINBOW	One day, Bathala planned a journey to Earth to visit his faithful followers. He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.

                            25. Instruction: Congratulations for making it this far! You’re almost done. Before you proceed to your next lesson, let us test your mastery. Today’s task is to read the following paragraphs and determine which pattern of development in writing is used. Are you ready? Here are the paragraphs. 1. Caring for yourself during these times is also caring for others. When we are allowed to go outside our houses, we should obey health practices. Some are skeptic about wearing masks. Others are still in doubt when asked to wash hands often or use alcohol and sanitizer. There are also people who question the need to maintain distance from each other in public areas. These safety measures are set because they are proven to be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus. They are not mere wishes to make our lives difficult. We are asked to do these health protocols because we are still in danger with the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Be responsible for yourself so that you will not be the reason for others to catch the virus. If you care for your loved ones, you must take care of yourself first. You do not want to be the one bringing the virus to your home. 2. The word quarantine is such a familiar one to almost everyone who are aware of the pandemic today. According to the Merriam- Webster dictionary online, it is a noun that has several meanings. It states that it is a period of 40 days. It may also be a term during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore. Also, it means a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or the transport of goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is also defined as a state of enforced isolation. For us, who have been in community quarantine for more or less three months, we know that quarantine means staying at home and waiting for the situation to be better. It is a condition wherein only those who have quarantine pass are allowed to go out for essential needs of the family. For others, the concept quarantine may also be equated to “no work, no pay” policy. Some may define it as something needed for people who are sick or those who came from places with COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, some probably sees quarantine as something that takes away their right to see family, relatives and friends. To sum it up, whatever or however we understand quarantine, we need to follow it as a safety protocol since we are still fighting this pandemic. 3. There are several similarities and differences between being a senior and junior high school student. Being a senior and junior high school student, both require you to study hard to be able to get desirable outputs and decent grades. Subjects are equally important to be given attention. It’s just that some subject areas may be easier to deal with depending on different factors. The subjects in senior high school (SHS) and junior high school (JHS) differ in a way that SHS subjects are more specific areas that are deemed essential for the track and strand you chose while in JHS, subjects are the general ones that we have since first grade, just increasing in complexity. Another similarity is that when you enter SHS and JHS, you have to prepare yourself to be a responsible part of the institution that you will enroll in. You should be ready to follow the policy that the school implements. Being a “senior” high student doesn’t mean you are superior or anything and being a “junior” high student doesn’t mean that you are under those in the SHS. The difference comes when there may be slight changes in the way rules and regulations are applied and the gravity of reprimands you may receive as you step up to higher grade levels or as you encounter different situations. In general, whether there are similarity or difference in being a Senior or Junior high school student, it’s is still up to you how you will handle it.​</h2><br />
