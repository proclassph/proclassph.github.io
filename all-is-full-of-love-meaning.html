                                            Look at this home, we need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you, not some gift, just you
The miracle is you
All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me
All of me</a>

                                            create a critique With Introduction,Body and Conclusion of this story The Parable Of The Rainbow Colors By:Juan M. Flavier It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism. The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</a>

Justify your answer by citing the tone, mood, and/or author's purpose. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.Shinano was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon.1. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.2. The trembling mother's voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. The son's surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart broke within and bowing to the ground.​</a>

FlavierIt all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism.The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</a>

                            4. Look at this home, we need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you, not some gift, just you
The miracle is you
All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me
All of me</h2><br />

                            5. create a critique With Introduction,Body and Conclusion of this story The Parable Of The Rainbow Colors By:Juan M. Flavier It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism. The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The Parable of the Rainbow Colors, written by Juan M. Flavier, is a short story that depicts a quarrel among different colors, each claiming to be the best. However, their dispute is interrupted by the rain, which teaches them a valuable lesson of cooperation and hope. In this critique, I will analyze the story's strengths and weaknesses, focusing on its theme, characters, and plot.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>The story's strength lies in its theme of cooperation and hope. The rain's intervention serves as a reminder to the colors that they need to work together to create something beautiful. The rainbow, which symbolizes unity and diversity, represents the idea that everyone has a unique role to play in the world. This theme is particularly relevant in today's world, where people often divide themselves into factions based on race, religion, or political beliefs. The story's message is clear: we need to learn to work together, despite our differences, to create a better world.</p><p></p><p>However, the story's characters are somewhat one-dimensional. The colors are defined solely by their attributes, such as red representing courage, yellow representing warmth, and green representing life. While this is a clever way of introducing the characters, it doesn't leave much room for character development. Additionally, the colors' argumentative nature feels forced, as if they were only created to serve the story's purpose rather than having a natural motivation to argue with one another.</p><p></p><p>The story's plot is simple and effective, but it lacks depth. The argument between the colors is resolved quickly, and the story ends with a simple solution. While this is suitable for a parable, it would have been nice to see a more nuanced resolution. The story could have explored the colors' individual strengths and weaknesses, and how they can be combined to create something even more beautiful than a rainbow.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The Parable of the Rainbow Colors is a simple but effective story with a powerful message of cooperation and hope. While the characters and plot could have been more developed, the story succeeds in conveying its theme to readers. Overall, the story serves as a reminder that we need to work together to create a better world, despite our differences.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper.Shinano was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon.1. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.2. The trembling mother's voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction.

FlavierIt all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism.The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>CONSTELLATION<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>constellation</strong> is a region on the divine circle where a gathering of noticeable stars frames an apparent framework or example, commonly addressing a creature, legendary individual or animal, or a lifeless thing.
</p><p>
</p><p>The beginnings of the most punctual <strong>constellations </strong>probably return to ancient times. Individuals utilized them to relate accounts of their convictions, encounters, creation, or folklore. Various societies and nations embraced their own <strong>constellations</strong>, some of which endured into the mid twentieth century before the present <strong>constellations </strong>were universally perceived. The acknowledgment of <strong>constellations</strong> has changed altogether after some time. Many changed in size or shape. Some became famous, just to drop into lack of definition. Some were restricted to a solitary culture or country.
</p><p>
</p><p>The 48 conventional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Peculiarities and Ptolemy's Almagest, however their starting point presumably originates before these works by a few centuries. <strong>Constellations</strong> in the far southern sky were added from the fifteenth century until the mid-eighteenth century when European wayfarers started going toward the Southern Half of the globe. Twelve old <strong>constellations </strong>have a place with the zodiac. The beginnings of the zodiac remain generally dubious; its mysterious divisions became noticeable c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean cosmology.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What is a constellation? - Brainly.ph
