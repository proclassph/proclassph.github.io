                                            "This article explores how poor, young men in a Manila relocation site enter into a brotherhood as a means to claim recognition from dominant society. It argues that by joining the brotherhood as a means to claim recognition from dominant society. It argues that by joining the brotherhood, which emanates out of a Greek - letter fraternity tradition in US and Philippines universities, the young men establish a link with people and networks in power. Drawing on ritual and religious sacrifice theory, the article illustrate how sacrificial violence in initiation rites becomes a performance of worth. This performance of valor and worth does indeed reach dominant society. After exploring the initiation ritual of the young men, the article then turns to explore the nature of the Philippines elite. This analysis suggests that while there are several, often competing strands within elite politics (legalistic, moralistic and clientelist), the efforts of the young men end up conforming and reproducing the elite and their own marginalization as unruly, uncouth goons of political machines. The author conducted fieldwork in Bagong Silang for a total of ten months. Over the course of his field work, he interacted with frat members, politicians and government officials. He was able to gain their trust and they shared their experiences about the brotherhood with him. The researcher was also allowed to observe some of the rituals of the fraternity." Jensen, S.

                                            The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.

                                            THE STORY OF THE OTHER NATIVITY  In the Holy Qu’ran’s version, there was no Joseph, nor a star. There was no gold,  or myrrh, or frankincense. Only Jesus and Mary and a palm tree.  There was a story that arrived on Philippine shores at least 356 years before the  arrival of the Spaniards to bring in the initial vestiges of the Christian belief system to the  Filipino people. The story was that of the birth of Iesa, the Islamic name of Jesus, as  described in the Holy Qu’ran. There was no manger. It was a birth with no magnificent star  in the night to lead no three magis, who bore no gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  There were no shepherds. There was no Joseph. But there was a tree, a palm tree, and  flowing water.  The story started with Maryam withdrawing, in seclusion from her family, to a place  facing east. There, the angel Jibrael appeared before her in the form of a man. Appalled,  she said that she sought refuge with God. The angel replied he was only a messenger of  God, sent to announce the gift of a righteous Son. But she could not possibly have a son,  she said, since no man had touched her and that she had not been unchaste. The angel  answered that God did this as a sign to mankind, and that this matter was already decreed.  And so, Maryam conceived the Child, and went to a far off place. When the  appointed time came, the pains of childbirth drove her beneath the shade of a date palm  tree, lamenting, “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight.”  Then a cry from below came—unclear still whether it was the Child or Jibrael—telling  her not to grieve, and that the Lord had provided a stream of water under her. And if she  would just shake the tree, fresh ripe dates would fall upon her. She was told to eat and drink,  and if she would see a human being, she should say that she had vowed a fast unto the Most  Beneficent and not speak to anyone that day.  DIWATA-1  The baseline design of the 50-kilogram micro-satellite is assigned to Tohoku  University while Hokkaido University is tasked with the payload and thermal design.  The payload subsystem includes a high-precision telescope (HPT) with 3-meter  spatial resolution and bands R\G\B\NIR. The HPT will provide surface reflectance data  with its derived products which will be used mostly for damage extent determination during  disasters and calamities. It can also be used for imaging natural and cultural heritage sites.    The second payload is a space-borne multi-spectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal  tunable filter (LCTF), which has an 80-meter spatial resolution. The LCTF allows for image  capture to be taken at 10 nanometer increments from 420nm – 650nm for the visible range  and 700nm – 1050nm for the near infrared region. Space products derived from this payload  can be used to determine the health and composition of the ocean, identify distribution and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms, and monitor coastal ecosystems.  With a spatial resolution of 7 kilometers, the wide field camera can used to complement  current weather forecasting capabilities. This sensor can potentially image cloud formations  and typhoons. Other subsystems included are command and data handling, attitude  determination and control, telemetry tracking and command, and power supply system.

                                            The Philippines’ COVID-19 Response: Securitising the Pandemic and Disciplining the Pasaway Karl Hapal (2021) Duterte has securitised COVID-19. This was achieved by fulfilling the three main elements of securitisation – the identification of an existential threat, emergency measures, and breaking free of rules. The securitisation of COVID-19 relied on framing the pandemic as war – a fight for the nation‟s survival. This was used to justify the draconian response by the government in an attempt to suppress the spread of the virus. This was primarily achieved by utilising and expanding the powers of the state‟s law enforcement apparatus. While Duterte has successfully securitised COVID-19, he has done so in a peculiar way. Duterte‟s securitising act relied on his populist rhetoric – a populist securitising act so to speak. Seen this way, Duterte‟s populist rhetoric served as the speech act that argued for and legitimised the securitisation of COVID-19. A key element of his populist securitising act was projecting the Philippines under siege by a sinister menace that may undermine the well-being of Filipinos. Duterte‟s populist securitising act invariably produced the pasaway archetype, an erring and bullheaded subject who, through its behaviour, became the embodiment of the virus‟ deadly qualities. Consequently, this was used to justify the intense policing and disciplining campaign against the pasaway. The war against COVID-19 turned into a war against the pasaway. The war against the pasaway is an attempt by the government to protect virtuous citizens from an unwanted and undesirable “other.” The disproportionate focus on the pasaway, however, is not only to mitigate its bullheaded behaviour. It is also informed by deep-seated class prejudices – the pasaway, in some ways, resembling the colonised and racialised other. The bifurcated narrative and the concomitant legitimisation of the use of the state‟s coercive power have long been used to produce, maintain, and reinforce societal divides. Beyond class, however, the underlying discourse that informed the production of the pasaway soon spread to other groups‟ perceived derailing of governmental efforts against the virus. In this sense, the pasaway became an empty signifier representing any other behaviour or actions deemed disagreeable. As an empty signifier, the campaign to address the pasaway extended to not only arresting bullheaded individuals but also to silence dissent. While the pasaway has become an encompassing pejorative term, it still relied on the bifurcated depiction of Filipino society and the need to save the virtuous from the errant. These dualist and oppositional narratives are, however, not new. They resemble what has informed and animated Duterte‟s campaigns against illegal drugs, criminality, corruption, oligarchy, communism, and so on. These narratives serve to present a bifurcated society, an existential threat, and an accompanying justification to pursue actions with force and haste in the name of social justice and national integrity. Take, for example, the war on drugs. Duterte depicted the widespread sale and use of illegal drugs as “a clear national security threat […] an invasion of a new kind […] [and] a war against our families and children” (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2020). Moreover, Duterte was able to frame the war on drugs as a noble crusade to salvage the Filipino nation (Hapal, 2019). In this crusade, society is seen as composed of good people and of demons (demonyo). The role of the government (particularly law enforcement) is “predictably, like avenging angels, to eliminate the demons to protect society – in other words, to keep the integrity of the „thin blue line‟” (Jensen and Hapal, 2018: 49). In this sense, the war against COVID-19 may be understood in conjunction with Duterte‟s other “wars on […]” Amid the pandemic, the government relentlessly continued its war on drugs, criminality, and corruption; intensified its war against terrorism alongside the passage of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Law; and escalated its campaign to dismantle so-called oligarchs, ABS-CBN – the largest media network in the Philippines – as one of the casualties. These wars are being fought to address a clear and present threat to ensure the well-being and future of the nation. And, more importantly, it presents an enemy to vanquish. The war on COVID-19 had serious consequences. Through the archetype of the pasaway, the government has, wittingly or unwittingly, turned the Filipino people into the enemy. This came to be as the virus, initially conceived as an “unseen enemy” creeping to infect, kill, and upend the lives of Filipinos, took a corporeal form. In other words, COVID-19‟s deadly and devastating qualities were soon embodied with the bullheaded character of the pasaway. It became the enemy order and, consequently, the object of disciplining and punishment. pasagot namn sa nakakaalam maraming salamat​</a>

                            3. "This article explores how poor, young men in a Manila relocation site enter into a brotherhood as a means to claim recognition from dominant society. It argues that by joining the brotherhood as a means to claim recognition from dominant society. It argues that by joining the brotherhood, which emanates out of a Greek - letter fraternity tradition in US and Philippines universities, the young men establish a link with people and networks in power. Drawing on ritual and religious sacrifice theory, the article illustrate how sacrificial violence in initiation rites becomes a performance of worth. This performance of valor and worth does indeed reach dominant society. After exploring the initiation ritual of the young men, the article then turns to explore the nature of the Philippines elite. This analysis suggests that while there are several, often competing strands within elite politics (legalistic, moralistic and clientelist), the efforts of the young men end up conforming and reproducing the elite and their own marginalization as unruly, uncouth goons of political machines. The author conducted fieldwork in Bagong Silang for a total of ten months. Over the course of his field work, he interacted with frat members, politicians and government officials. He was able to gain their trust and they shared their experiences about the brotherhood with him. The researcher was also allowed to observe some of the rituals of the fraternity." Jensen, S.

                        <p>The example above highlights several characteristics and strengths of qualitative research.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, qualitative research is able to provide rich, detailed and contextualized data about a particular phenomenon. In the article, the author was able to conduct ten months of fieldwork and interact with various stakeholders involved in the brotherhood, including frat members, politicians, and government officials. By doing so, the author was able to gain a deeper understanding of the social dynamics and cultural practices of the brotherhood, and to provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between the brotherhood and dominant society.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, qualitative research allows for the exploration and generation of new theories and hypotheses. In the article, the author draws on ritual and religious sacrifice theory to explain how sacrificial violence in initiation rites becomes a performance of worth. This theoretical framework is not explicitly stated in the literature on fraternities in the Philippines, and the author is able to generate new insights by applying this theory to the context of the brotherhood.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, qualitative research emphasizes the importance of context and subjectivity. In the article, the author recognizes that the experiences and perspectives of the young men in the brotherhood are shaped by their social, economic, and political context. The author also acknowledges that his own perspective and positionality as a researcher may influence his analysis and interpretation of the data.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the example above demonstrates the ability of qualitative research to provide in-depth and nuanced insights into complex social phenomena, and to generate new theories and hypotheses. It also highlights the importance of context and subjectivity in understanding social phenomena, and the need for researchers to critically reflect on their own positionality and biases.</p><br />

                            4. The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.

                            5. THE STORY OF THE OTHER NATIVITY  In the Holy Qu’ran’s version, there was no Joseph, nor a star. There was no gold,  or myrrh, or frankincense. Only Jesus and Mary and a palm tree.  There was a story that arrived on Philippine shores at least 356 years before the  arrival of the Spaniards to bring in the initial vestiges of the Christian belief system to the  Filipino people. The story was that of the birth of Iesa, the Islamic name of Jesus, as  described in the Holy Qu’ran. There was no manger. It was a birth with no magnificent star  in the night to lead no three magis, who bore no gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  There were no shepherds. There was no Joseph. But there was a tree, a palm tree, and  flowing water.  The story started with Maryam withdrawing, in seclusion from her family, to a place  facing east. There, the angel Jibrael appeared before her in the form of a man. Appalled,  she said that she sought refuge with God. The angel replied he was only a messenger of  God, sent to announce the gift of a righteous Son. But she could not possibly have a son,  she said, since no man had touched her and that she had not been unchaste. The angel  answered that God did this as a sign to mankind, and that this matter was already decreed.  And so, Maryam conceived the Child, and went to a far off place. When the  appointed time came, the pains of childbirth drove her beneath the shade of a date palm  tree, lamenting, “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight.”  Then a cry from below came—unclear still whether it was the Child or Jibrael—telling  her not to grieve, and that the Lord had provided a stream of water under her. And if she  would just shake the tree, fresh ripe dates would fall upon her. She was told to eat and drink,  and if she would see a human being, she should say that she had vowed a fast unto the Most  Beneficent and not speak to anyone that day.  DIWATA-1  The baseline design of the 50-kilogram micro-satellite is assigned to Tohoku  University while Hokkaido University is tasked with the payload and thermal design.  The payload subsystem includes a high-precision telescope (HPT) with 3-meter  spatial resolution and bands R\G\B\NIR. The HPT will provide surface reflectance data  with its derived products which will be used mostly for damage extent determination during  disasters and calamities. It can also be used for imaging natural and cultural heritage sites.    The second payload is a space-borne multi-spectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal  tunable filter (LCTF), which has an 80-meter spatial resolution. The LCTF allows for image  capture to be taken at 10 nanometer increments from 420nm – 650nm for the visible range  and 700nm – 1050nm for the near infrared region. Space products derived from this payload  can be used to determine the health and composition of the ocean, identify distribution and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms, and monitor coastal ecosystems.  With a spatial resolution of 7 kilometers, the wide field camera can used to complement  current weather forecasting capabilities. This sensor can potentially image cloud formations  and typhoons. Other subsystems included are command and data handling, attitude  determination and control, telemetry tracking and command, and power supply system.
