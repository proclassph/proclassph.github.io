                                            THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

                                            What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</a>

                                            Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5. How did the author related to his topic the world? ​</a>

                                            What is love? How can one define it? Love is defined by a lot of things. But did you know that there are different types of it? There are at least 6 types of love. One, is Philia which means a kind of love that occurs with friends, families, brothers and sisters. Second is Pragma which means enduring love. This kind of love is able to overcome any type of obstacle or struggles. Next is, Storge which is love for family. The bond we make with them is called that kind of love. Eros is the fourth one which is very familiar to everyone because it means romantic love. The fifth is Philautia which means self-love. This type of love focuses on one’s ability to take or him or herself not to the point of selfishness. And the last one which is said to be the strongest type of love is Agape. This means a selfless kind of love. A love that surpasses all things which can only be found in putting another than one’s self. What is love for you? No matter what it is, love is a beautiful thing.

Nolan: I love to eat banana!
Marjun: Really? I thought you love durian?
Nolan: Hmmm. Well, whether banana or durian I would still love it. Fruits are all
 delicious.
Jamaica: You’re right, Nolan. But I would still prefer durian. Durians from Davao are
 the best. How about you Azzyl?
Azzyl: I always like lanzones especially when it is from Camiguin. Lanzones from
 Camiguin are the sweetest.
Jamaica: Really? Maybe next time you should give us some.
Azzyl: Sure.
Marjun: Don’t you love mango? It’s our national fruit. And we have a mango tree in
 our backyard. Mangoes are nutritious and rich in fiber.
Nolan: Wow... You mean it is as sweet as the mangoes in Guimaras?
Marjun: Actually, the seedling came from Guimaras.
Jamaica: I also heard that from my mother. Mangoes from Guimaras are known to
 be sweet and juicy.
Azzyl: Actually, as what our teacher says, all fruits from the Philippines are sweet
 and nutritious.
Nolan: Yes, I agree.</a>

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</a>

By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

                            3. What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</h2><br />

                            10. Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5. How did the author related to his topic the world? ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The figurative language used in the lyrics is:</p><p></p><p>Simile: "I'm in a field of dandelions, wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine." - This is a simile because it uses the word "like" to compare being in a field of dandelions to the act of wishing on every one of them, implying that the person's desire for the other person is as abundant as the dandelions in the field.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime, and I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the rarity of finding true love by saying it only comes once in a lifetime, implying that the person believes the other person is their one true love.</p><p></p><p>Metaphor: "Dandelion, into the wind you go, won't you let my darling know?" - This is a metaphor because it compares a dandelion being blown by the wind to the act of conveying a message to the person's "darling." It implies that the person is hoping the message reaches their loved one just like a dandelion disperses its seeds through the wind.</p><p></p><p>Personification: "I see forever in your eyes" - This is personification because it gives human qualities, such as seeing forever, to the eyes of the person the lyrics are addressed to. It implies a deep emotional connection and suggests that the person's eyes hold a sense of eternity.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "I've never felt so alive and free, when you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the intensity of the person's feelings when the other person is looking at them. It implies that their happiness and sense of freedom are greatly amplified in the presence of the other person.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Glad to help ^^ </p><p>pa brainly if you don't mind </p><p></p><br />

                            17. What is love? How can one define it? Love is defined by a lot of things. But did you know that there are different types of it? There are at least 6 types of love. One, is Philia which means a kind of love that occurs with friends, families, brothers and sisters. Second is Pragma which means enduring love. This kind of love is able to overcome any type of obstacle or struggles. Next is, Storge which is love for family. The bond we make with them is called that kind of love. Eros is the fourth one which is very familiar to everyone because it means romantic love. The fifth is Philautia which means self-love. This type of love focuses on one’s ability to take or him or herself not to the point of selfishness. And the last one which is said to be the strongest type of love is Agape. This means a selfless kind of love. A love that surpasses all things which can only be found in putting another than one’s self. What is love for you? No matter what it is, love is a beautiful thing.

Who is the poetic persona of the poem?2. What is that line in the first stanza that is repeated in the second? What is the difference in meaning between the two? Why is there a question mark? 3. We have the lines "Till seashells are broken pieces/From God's own bright teeth" in the last stanza. What does this imply? How does God show His great love? Can you cite evidences or stories that affirm His love? 4. How is love being portrayed in the poem? 5. In the third stanza, why do you think the speaker mentions that all love is to be scaled down? How do you scale down your love? Give examples.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The poetic persona of the poem is not explicitly stated, but it is likely the author herself, Edith Tiempo.The line that is repeated in the first and second stanza is "All that I love". The difference in meaning between the two is that in the first stanza, it seems to be a rhetorical question, while in the second stanza, it is being affirmed that all the things mentioned are indeed things that the speaker loves.The line "Till seashells are broken pieces/From God's own bright teeth" implies that even the smallest and seemingly insignificant things in life are evidence of God's great love. This is seen in the beauty and intricacy of seashells, which are created by God. Examples of stories that affirm God's love could include the story of Jesus sacrificing himself for humanity or the story of the prodigal son in the Bible.Love is being portrayed as something that is cherished and valued, and that can be kept and treasured in small, physical objects.In the third stanza, the speaker mentions scaling down love to emphasize the importance of keeping memories and cherished objects in a compact and tangible form. Scaling down love allows the speaker to keep all that she loves with her at all times, making it easier to remember and cherish the memories associated with those objects. Scaling down love can be done in different ways depending on the individual. For example, keeping sentimental items in a small box or container, carrying a locket or other small keepsake, or even just taking photographs of special moments or objects can help scale down love into something tangible and manageable.<p></p><br />

Nolan: I love to eat banana!
Marjun: Really? I thought you love durian?
Nolan: Hmmm. Well, whether banana or durian I would still love it. Fruits are all
 delicious.
Jamaica: You’re right, Nolan. But I would still prefer durian. Durians from Davao are
 the best. How about you Azzyl?
Azzyl: I always like lanzones especially when it is from Camiguin. Lanzones from
 Camiguin are the sweetest.
Jamaica: Really? Maybe next time you should give us some.
Azzyl: Sure.
Marjun: Don’t you love mango? It’s our national fruit. And we have a mango tree in
 our backyard. Mangoes are nutritious and rich in fiber.
Nolan: Wow... You mean it is as sweet as the mangoes in Guimaras?
Marjun: Actually, the seedling came from Guimaras.
Jamaica: I also heard that from my mother. Mangoes from Guimaras are known to
 be sweet and juicy.

 and nutritious.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>In truth, I think the meaning of the song, is that whoever was singing this, wanted to seek and find God. They state in a few verses that he/she was made by God, and yet, they have never seen him. They ask of God to teach him/her how to find him, to seek him. They state that they cannot see him, unless he teaches them, or that they cannot find him unless he shows himself to them. They want to love God when they find him, and they want him to teach their hearts on how to find him.</strong></p><p><strong>The line that I found interesting was:</strong></p><p><strong>"</strong><strong>Teach my heart where to find You, for I cannot see You unless You teach me, or find You unless You show yourself to me."</strong></p><p><strong>I found it interesting because it shows that no matter how hard we try, only God can show himself. No amount of will and force can make God show himself to us. It is him we need to find, not the other way around. We are not the ones who will show ourselves to him, but rather, he would show himself to us.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        Answer:EXODUS 20:2-5
<p><strong>In </strong><strong>my</strong><strong> opinion, this verse tells you to be loyal to </strong><strong>God</strong><strong>, for </strong><strong>He</strong><strong> has loved you and helped you for a long time.

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</h2><br />
