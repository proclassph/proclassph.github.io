Any more words? I think you&#039;ve spoke enough
&#039;Cause the pubs are empty and they&#039;re closing up
When you&#039;re spitting spite as fast as saliva
But with the prose of a standard English drunk, she says
&quot;Hope the saltwater ruins your clothes
And I hope you spend the rest of your life sleeping alone
I hope the problems that make your life harder
Sit stubborn in your stomach like your kidney stones&quot;, and yet
All this over a kiss
You weren&#039;t there, why you pressed by this?
Now it&#039;s turning three in the morning
The bouncer&#039;s put you on his third warning
But I&#039;m still here, I&#039;m not leaving
You won&#039;t get what you need (all this over a kiss)
You know it&#039;s always the same, it&#039;s all just a game
If I had it my way, you&#039;d sleep on the concrete
Floor, what&#039;d you say to me? (All this over a kiss)
&#039;Cause I&#039;m not sure
I&#039;m not sure they&#039;d let you off easily
It&#039;s a -off march up to bus stop station
With -up eyes glossed with early conversations
And the consequence of your desperation
Is the people on the night bus have to listen to you
And all I&#039;m saying is (woo)
How can you look at yourself in the windowpane
Without wanting to hit yourself?
But your fist descends through the condensation
All this over a kiss
You weren&#039;t there, so why you pressed by this?
Now it&#039;s turning three in the morning
The bouncer&#039;s put you on his third warning
But I&#039;m still here, I&#039;m not leaving
You won&#039;t get what you need (all this over a kiss)

                                            Activity 1Directions. Write the expressions which signal causes and effects in the essay belowWhy Do People Keep Pets?manytypesWhat are pets? Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress. Studies have shown that having pets reduce the risk ofgetting depression. Pets like dogs need exercise. We can even take them for walksaround the park. The pet owners will be healthier by exercising with their pets too.When the pet owners take their dogs for walks, they will also be meeting other petowners. Therefore, this will benefit both the pets and the owners. It is a win-winsituation for the pets and owners.In conclusion, it is very obvious that there are many reasons why people keeppets. Animals will love you unconditionally unlike some human beings. They willnot judge or discriminate you based on your looks whether you are fat, ugly, shortor tall. They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</a>

Please allow me to ascend to heaven earlier!” Suddenly a voice said, “But your time on earth is not yet over.” The datu felt a little disappointed at this and left the palace, then went alone for a walk around the forest. Suddenly an old man came up to him. Knowing the grievance in his heart, the old man tried to cheer him up by saying, “It might surprise you to know, my Lord, that we can already find heaven on earth!” With that remark, he led the datu to a place where there grew a king plant that has a long tall body, with long leaves that looks very much like bamboo.” He went on to say, “This is a heavenly plant, try tasting its stem, it’s incredibly sweet.” The datu started to chew its stem and found it indeed to be very sweet. He really felt as if he’s gone to heaven. He also learned from the old man that the tall shoots are called tubo. The datu thanked the old man and took a sample of the purple-colored stalks home with him. From that time on, he ordered his people to plant more of this tubo, which we know it today as sugarcane which is still chewed or squeezed into cold drinks, or refined into brown and white sugar. COMPREHENSION CHECK: 1. What is the setting of the story? 2. Who is Datu in a certain tribe? 3. How does the datu feel about his life? 4. How does the old man cher up the datu? 5. What makes the tubo a heavenly plant?​</a>

                                            The Harvest That Never CameA long time ago, the Swedish and Danish people were great friends, which was just as well, as their countries were next to each other. Arild Ugerup was the son of a noble Danish family He had a sweetheart, Thale Thott, and they planned to marry soon. But before the couple could make the arrangements, King Erik of Sweden declared war on the Danish people and Arild was captured. Poor Arild was thrown into a dark prison cell and left there alone. He greatly missed his home, his family, and his sweetheart Thale. Arild wondered whether he would ever get to see them again. Then one day, his jailer handed him a letterMy dearest Arild,You know how much I miss you and wish that I could be with you, even for just one hour. Now, I must bring you bad news. My father wants me to marry soon and he says that, as there is no chance of your coming home, I must marry a nobleman from the next village. I fear I will never see you again, dear Arild. It is a terrible thing, but I must obey my father.Your sweetheart,Thale ThottArild was infuriated at what he read. He threw himself at the bolts of the prison door and shook the bars of his prison windows. In his desperation, he even tried to dig a way out through the floor. "If only I were stronger, I could break out of here and go to Thale." That night when he had calmed down, he thought of a better way to do things. "I'll never be strong enough to break out of here. But I can find a way out using my mind." Dipping his pen in an inkwell, he began to write Your Majesty,I know that I am your prisoner. But for the sake of the friendship between us, grant this boon. I have a sweetheart who I must marry soon or stand losing her. I beg Your Majesty to let me go home to marry her. I will stay only as long as it takes to plant and harvest a crop---for it would not be right to leave my wife as soon as we are married. I solemnly swear that after harvesting the crop, I will come straight back to prison. Before long, King Erik's consent came. All went according to Arild's plan. Thale and him were married. Spring, the time for planting, arrived. In a few short months, Arild would have to harvest his crop and return to captivity To stall his return, he thought long and hard on which crop to plant. Then, he went out to the fields and planted each seed of his chosen crop six footsteps apart. Months passed and the once-green leaves shriveled and turned brown. A messenger arrived to escort Arild back to his prison cell. "The King has kept his part of the bargain. Now it is time for you to keep yours, Arild Ugerup," he told Arild. "But my crop has not even sprouted yet, much less been harvested!" The messenger was astounded at this reply. "Not yet sprouted! What in the world did you plant?" "Pine trees." The messenger rushed back to King Erik's court and relayed all that had happened to His Majesty. Upon hearing Arild's cunning, rhe king laughed. "Such a man does not deserve to remain a prisoner!"And Arild stayed with the wife he had fought for so hard. And around his land, a lush green forest attest to his devotion to her.1.

                                            ECHO
Echo, a beautiful mountain nymph, was a great talker and always had to have the last word. 
She was a favorite of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Together they hunted in the woods, swam in 
mountain pools, and caught fish for meals. But Echo’s delightful life was destroyed, all because she 
tried to protect her friends from Hera’s wrath.
 One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that 
her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.
 Echo did not know which nymph was Zeus’s favorite, and so she started a conversation with 
Hera in order to let all the other nymphs escape.” Isn’t it lovely here?” she said. “Yes, indeed,” Hera 
replied, “but I am very busy right now and have no time for talk.”
 “It seems to me you are busy talking,” said Echo, “which is the nicest way to be busy, don’t 
you agree?” She went on and on, and every time Hera tried to get away from her, Echo asked another 
question. By the time Hera got away and ran to the nymphs’ pool, all the nymphs had fled. “This is your doing,” said Hera to Echo. “You kept talking to let them escape. And I shall 
punish you for that. You shall never be able to speak first, but shall only be able to repeat what others 
say. You shall always have the last word.”
 Soon after that, Echo fell in love with a handsome young hunter named Narcissus. She 
followed him through the woods, hoping to make him notice her. But she could not speak first and 
had to wait for him to speak to her.
 One day her chance came. Narcissus became separated from his friends and called out, 
“Is anyone here?” “Here,” called Echo. Narcissus could not see her, for she was behind a bush. He 
shouted, “Come,” thinking she was one of his companions, and she called back, “Come.”
 “Let us be together,” called Narcissus, for he could not see anybody. “Let us be together,” 
called Echo, and she ran up to him with her arms open, ready to embrace him. But Narcissus said 
cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.” “Have power 
over me,” said Echo pleadingly, but Narcissus bounded away, leaving Echo alone and ashamed. 
Afterward she lived in a cave, and finally, because of her great grief, she shrank to nothing. The only 
thing left of her was her voice, which echoed through the mountains, repeating the words of anyone 
who called.
1.The ancient Greeks believed that their gods acted like ordinary people and even experienced 
human emotions. Consider Hera’s feelings and actions in the highlighted part. In what ways is she 
like a human being? (highlighted part: Hera’s wrath.One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.)
2. Based in the highlighted part, it shows how Narcissus react to Echo. How is the highlighted 
part important in the story? (highlighted part: But Narcissus said cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.”)
3.This myth tell us about unrequited love. If you were Echo how would you handle the 
situation?
4.Some myths attempt to explain how something in the world came to be. What natural 
phenomenon is explained in this myth?
5. If you could change feelings or behavior of someone to be less like Echo or Narcissus, how 
would you change him/her?</a>

Any more words? I think you've spoke enough
'Cause the pubs are empty and they're closing up
When you're spitting spite as fast as saliva
But with the prose of a standard English drunk, she says
"Hope the saltwater ruins your clothes
And I hope you spend the rest of your life sleeping alone
I hope the problems that make your life harder
Sit stubborn in your stomach like your kidney stones", and yet
All this over a kiss
You weren't there, why you pressed by this?
Now it's turning three in the morning
The bouncer's put you on his third warning
But I'm still here, I'm not leaving
You won't get what you need (all this over a kiss)
You know it's always the same, it's all just a game
If I had it my way, you'd sleep on the concrete
Floor, what'd you say to me? (All this over a kiss)
'Cause I'm not sure
I'm not sure they'd let you off easily
It's a -off march up to bus stop station
With -up eyes glossed with early conversations
And the consequence of your desperation
Is the people on the night bus have to listen to you
And all I'm saying is (woo)
How can you look at yourself in the windowpane
Without wanting to hit yourself?
But your fist descends through the condensation
All this over a kiss
You weren't there, so why you pressed by this?
Now it's turning three in the morning
The bouncer's put you on his third warning
But I'm still here, I'm not leaving
You won't get what you need (all this over a kiss)
You know it's always the same, it's all just a game
If I had it my way, you'd sleep on the concrete
Floor, what'd you say to me? (All this over a kiss)
'Cause I'm not sure

                            2. Activity 1Directions. Write the expressions which signal causes and effects in the essay belowWhy Do People Keep Pets?manytypesWhat are pets? Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress. Studies have shown that having pets reduce the risk ofgetting depression. Pets like dogs need exercise. We can even take them for walksaround the park. The pet owners will be healthier by exercising with their pets too.When the pet owners take their dogs for walks, they will also be meeting other petowners. Therefore, this will benefit both the pets and the owners. It is a win-winsituation for the pets and owners.In conclusion, it is very obvious that there are many reasons why people keeppets. Animals will love you unconditionally unlike some human beings. They willnot judge or discriminate you based on your looks whether you are fat, ugly, shortor tall. They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</h2><br />

                            5. THE LEGEND OF THE SUGARCANE Once upon a time, there lived an old datu (chieftain). One day, he prayed to Bathala (God) saying, “I am getting older and weaker every day. As to my life here on earth, I find it increasingly boring to live on. Please allow me to ascend to heaven earlier!” Suddenly a voice said, “But your time on earth is not yet over.” The datu felt a little disappointed at this and left the palace, then went alone for a walk around the forest. Suddenly an old man came up to him. Knowing the grievance in his heart, the old man tried to cheer him up by saying, “It might surprise you to know, my Lord, that we can already find heaven on earth!” With that remark, he led the datu to a place where there grew a king plant that has a long tall body, with long leaves that looks very much like bamboo.” He went on to say, “This is a heavenly plant, try tasting its stem, it’s incredibly sweet.” The datu started to chew its stem and found it indeed to be very sweet. He really felt as if he’s gone to heaven. He also learned from the old man that the tall shoots are called tubo. The datu thanked the old man and took a sample of the purple-colored stalks home with him. From that time on, he ordered his people to plant more of this tubo, which we know it today as sugarcane which is still chewed or squeezed into cold drinks, or refined into brown and white sugar.

                            7. The Harvest That Never CameA long time ago, the Swedish and Danish people were great friends, which was just as well, as their countries were next to each other. Arild Ugerup was the son of a noble Danish family He had a sweetheart, Thale Thott, and they planned to marry soon. But before the couple could make the arrangements, King Erik of Sweden declared war on the Danish people and Arild was captured. Poor Arild was thrown into a dark prison cell and left there alone. He greatly missed his home, his family, and his sweetheart Thale. Arild wondered whether he would ever get to see them again. Then one day, his jailer handed him a letterMy dearest Arild,You know how much I miss you and wish that I could be with you, even for just one hour. Now, I must bring you bad news. My father wants me to marry soon and he says that, as there is no chance of your coming home, I must marry a nobleman from the next village. I fear I will never see you again, dear Arild. It is a terrible thing, but I must obey my father.Your sweetheart,Thale ThottArild was infuriated at what he read. He threw himself at the bolts of the prison door and shook the bars of his prison windows. In his desperation, he even tried to dig a way out through the floor. "If only I were stronger, I could break out of here and go to Thale." That night when he had calmed down, he thought of a better way to do things. "I'll never be strong enough to break out of here. But I can find a way out using my mind." Dipping his pen in an inkwell, he began to write Your Majesty,I know that I am your prisoner. But for the sake of the friendship between us, grant this boon. I have a sweetheart who I must marry soon or stand losing her. I beg Your Majesty to let me go home to marry her. I will stay only as long as it takes to plant and harvest a crop---for it would not be right to leave my wife as soon as we are married. I solemnly swear that after harvesting the crop, I will come straight back to prison. Before long, King Erik's consent came. All went according to Arild's plan. Thale and him were married. Spring, the time for planting, arrived. In a few short months, Arild would have to harvest his crop and return to captivity To stall his return, he thought long and hard on which crop to plant. Then, he went out to the fields and planted each seed of his chosen crop six footsteps apart. Months passed and the once-green leaves shriveled and turned brown. A messenger arrived to escort Arild back to his prison cell. "The King has kept his part of the bargain. Now it is time for you to keep yours, Arild Ugerup," he told Arild. "But my crop has not even sprouted yet, much less been harvested!" The messenger was astounded at this reply. "Not yet sprouted! What in the world did you plant?" "Pine trees." The messenger rushed back to King Erik's court and relayed all that had happened to His Majesty. Upon hearing Arild's cunning, rhe king laughed. "Such a man does not deserve to remain a prisoner!"And Arild stayed with the wife he had fought for so hard. And around his land, a lush green forest attest to his devotion to her.1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. If you were Arild, how would you feel after reading Thale's letter? What conflicts does he face?</p><p></p><p><strong>If I were Arild, I would feel devastated and heartbroken after reading Thale's letter. I would also feel frustrated and angry that I am unable to be with Thale due to being imprisoned. The conflict Arild faces is the struggle to balance his love for Thale and his duty to return to prison as promised.</strong></p><p></p><p>2. Why do you think King Erik agreed to the request?</p><p></p><p><strong>King Erik may have agreed to the request because he values the friendship between him and Arild and wants to show mercy and compassion towards Arild. He may also have seen the request as an opportunity to demonstrate his generosity and kindness.</strong></p><p></p><p>3. Do you think Arild was a true friend to King Erik?</p><p></p><p><strong>Arild demonstrated his loyalty and respect towards King Erik by asking for his permission and keeping his promise to return to prison after planting and harvesting a crop. This shows that Arild values the friendship between them and is willing to abide by the rules set by King Erik. Therefore, I believe Arild was a true friend to King Erik.</strong></p><p></p><p>4.

                            11. ECHO
Echo, a beautiful mountain nymph, was a great talker and always had to have the last word. 
She was a favorite of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Together they hunted in the woods, swam in 
mountain pools, and caught fish for meals. But Echo’s delightful life was destroyed, all because she 
tried to protect her friends from Hera’s wrath.
 One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that 
her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.
 Echo did not know which nymph was Zeus’s favorite, and so she started a conversation with 
Hera in order to let all the other nymphs escape.” Isn’t it lovely here?” she said. “Yes, indeed,” Hera 
replied, “but I am very busy right now and have no time for talk.”
 “It seems to me you are busy talking,” said Echo, “which is the nicest way to be busy, don’t 
you agree?” She went on and on, and every time Hera tried to get away from her, Echo asked another 
question. By the time Hera got away and ran to the nymphs’ pool, all the nymphs had fled. “This is your doing,” said Hera to Echo. “You kept talking to let them escape. And I shall 
punish you for that. You shall never be able to speak first, but shall only be able to repeat what others 
say. You shall always have the last word.”
 Soon after that, Echo fell in love with a handsome young hunter named Narcissus. She 
followed him through the woods, hoping to make him notice her. But she could not speak first and 
had to wait for him to speak to her.
 One day her chance came. Narcissus became separated from his friends and called out, 
“Is anyone here?” “Here,” called Echo. Narcissus could not see her, for she was behind a bush. He 
shouted, “Come,” thinking she was one of his companions, and she called back, “Come.”
 “Let us be together,” called Narcissus, for he could not see anybody. “Let us be together,” 
called Echo, and she ran up to him with her arms open, ready to embrace him. But Narcissus said 
cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.” “Have power 
over me,” said Echo pleadingly, but Narcissus bounded away, leaving Echo alone and ashamed. 
Afterward she lived in a cave, and finally, because of her great grief, she shrank to nothing. The only 
thing left of her was her voice, which echoed through the mountains, repeating the words of anyone 
who called.
1.The ancient Greeks believed that their gods acted like ordinary people and even experienced 
human emotions. Consider Hera’s feelings and actions in the highlighted part. In what ways is she 
like a human being? (highlighted part: Hera’s wrath.One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.)
2. Based in the highlighted part, it shows how Narcissus react to Echo. How is the highlighted 
part important in the story? (highlighted part: But Narcissus said cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.”)
3.This myth tell us about unrequited love. If you were Echo how would you handle the 
situation?
4.Some myths attempt to explain how something in the world came to be. What natural 
phenomenon is explained in this myth?
5. If you could change feelings or behavior of someone to be less like Echo or Narcissus, how 
would you change him/her?</h2><br />
