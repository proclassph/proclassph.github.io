SONNET
Jose Garcia Vila
Fist a poem must be magical
Then musical as a seagull
It must be a brightness moving
And hold secret a bird's flowering.
It must be a slender as a bell,
And it must hold fire as well
It must have the wisdom of bows
And it must kneel like a rose.
It must be able to hear
The luminance of dove and deer.
It must be able to hide
What it seeks, bke a bride.
And over all I would like to hover
God, smiling from the poem's cover.

                                            (THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO).STORY:I was quite happy in my new place, and if there was one thing that I missed it must not be thought I was discontented; all who had to do with me were good and I had a light airy stable and the best of food. What more could I want? Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week, month after month, and no doubt year after year, I must stand up in a stable night and day except when I am wanted, and then I must be just as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years. Straps here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes. Now, I am not complaining, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say that for a young horse full of strength and spirits, who has been used to some large field or plain where he can fling up his head and toss up his tail and gallop away at full speed, then round and back again with a snort to his companions - I say it is hard never to have a bit more liberty to do as you like. Sometimes, when I have had less exercise than usual, Ihave felt so full of life and spring that when John has taken me out to exercise I really could not keep quiet; do what I would, it seemed as if I must jump, or dance, or prance, and many a good shake I know I must have given him, especially at the first; but he was always good and patient.(THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO.)​</a>

                                            What does this poem mean or say?
Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</a>

Fist a poem must be magical
Then musical as a seagull
It must be a brightness moving
And hold secret a bird's flowering.
It must be a slender as a bell,
And it must hold fire as well
It must have the wisdom of bows
And it must kneel like a rose.
It must be able to hear
The luminance of dove and deer.
It must be able to hide
What it seeks, bke a bride.
And over all I would like to hover
God, smiling from the poem's cover.

                            7. (THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO).STORY:I was quite happy in my new place, and if there was one thing that I missed it must not be thought I was discontented; all who had to do with me were good and I had a light airy stable and the best of food. What more could I want? Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week, month after month, and no doubt year after year, I must stand up in a stable night and day except when I am wanted, and then I must be just as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years. Straps here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes. Now, I am not complaining, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say that for a young horse full of strength and spirits, who has been used to some large field or plain where he can fling up his head and toss up his tail and gallop away at full speed, then round and back again with a snort to his companions - I say it is hard never to have a bit more liberty to do as you like. Sometimes, when I have had less exercise than usual, Ihave felt so full of life and spring that when John has taken me out to exercise I really could not keep quiet; do what I would, it seemed as if I must jump, or dance, or prance, and many a good shake I know I must have given him, especially at the first; but he was always good and patient.(THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO.)​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) The saying "It is better to give than to receive" implies that it is more fulfilling to be the giver rather than the receiver in any kind of transaction. However, this can be seen as contradictory as sometimes receiving can bring joy and happiness to people's lives.</p><p></p><p>2) The quote by Mother Teresa highlights the paradoxical nature of love, where the more love you give, the more love you receive. It suggests that love has the power to overcome any hurt or pain, and that by loving selflessly, you can find more love and happiness.</p><p></p><p>3) The saying "in order for seed to grow, it must die" refers to the idea that sometimes in order to achieve growth or transformation, something must come to an end or be sacrificed. It suggests that the process of transformation can be painful, but necessary for new growth to occur. This can be seen as contradictory as it implies that in order for something to live, it must first die.</p><br />

                            24. What does this poem mean or say?
Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</h2><br />
