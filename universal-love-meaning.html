                                            VALENTINE IS.. When some students began decorating their rooms with Valentine trimmings, a critic asked, “Is it necessary to celebrate Valentines’ Day? Is not a good for nothing occasion like Christmas?Contrary to what the critic said, Valentine’s Day is not just a froth and flower occasion devoid of any meaning at all. It has a distinct place and function in contemporary life; otherwise its observance would have been dropped after the Vatican had declared St. Valentine’s Day. To them, the existence of the patron saint is immaterial.What is important is, that people still believe in the existence of love, love between lovers, love between children and their elders, love among men, and love between man and God.These kinds of love are universal. They are the ties that bind the world together to keep it from crumbling into hatred and wickedness     a. Editorial of Special Occasion     b. Editorial of Criticism     c.

                                            Lesson 3 UNIVERSAL SET AND SUBSETS You have illustrated cardinality of sets. A set may be finite or infinite. It depends on the number of element/s it contain/s. How about if we have a set whose elements are the elements of another set? What do we call this set Can you illustrate subset? Can you illustrate universal set? 1. Objective: After performing the activities here in this lesson, you are expected to illustrate universal set and subset. II. Vocabulary List The universal set, U, is the set that contains all elements under consideration. If all the elements of set A are also elements of set B, then A is a subset of B. This means that subsets can be created from any defined universal set. The set of natural numbers itself is a subset of the set of real numbers, which could be another example of a universal set. Equal sets have the same element, even though they could be out of order. Thus, it has equal cardinality. Equivalent sets have different element but have the same amount of element. Remember: Equal sets are always an equivalent set. Equivalent sets may or may not an equal set. III. Learning Activities A. Most of us love to eat ice cream.

Why does Schopenhauer think that suffering outweighs pleasure in life? Why does Schopenhauer reject God as a source of meaning in life? Why does he think that love is not capable of providing meaning either? If life is as meaningless as he intimates, does he think that suicide is an appropriate choice? Why or why not? What advice does Schopenhauer offer in terms of trying to inhabit a world with such woes? What arguments could one use to challenge him? Where do you stand on Schopenhauer's views, and why? Be sure to use concrete example to illustrate your points.

Some people have a hard time remembering to get their loved one’s appropriate gifts on Valentine’s Day. This can lead to painfully long talks about “where the relationship stands”. Perhaps the best way to avoid these talks is by taking the moral highroad. Instead of forgetting these holidays, choose not to celebrate them. Inform your loved one that you don’t want to buy into the materialism and commercialism of these manufactured holidays. Tell that person that you want to have a relationship with them, not the marketers, and that you want to celebrate your love every day, not just one day a year. It’s a tough pitch, but if you can make the sale then you’ll be in the clear for life.

Sir Isaac Newton was contemplating the universe in his garden one day in 1665 when he noticed an apple fall from a tree. Newton wondered to himself, “Why should the apple always fall to the ground? Why does it not go sideways or upwards but directly toward the Earth’s center?” After much contemplation, Newton concluded that objects are pulled to the Earth through a force that he called gravity, which means heaviness in Latin. On July 5th, 1687 Newton formally expressed his law of universal gravitation in a series of books called The Principia.

                            7. VALENTINE IS.. When some students began decorating their rooms with Valentine trimmings, a critic asked, “Is it necessary to celebrate Valentines’ Day? Is not a good for nothing occasion like Christmas?Contrary to what the critic said, Valentine’s Day is not just a froth and flower occasion devoid of any meaning at all. It has a distinct place and function in contemporary life; otherwise its observance would have been dropped after the Vatican had declared St. Valentine’s Day. To them, the existence of the patron saint is immaterial.What is important is, that people still believe in the existence of love, love between lovers, love between children and their elders, love among men, and love between man and God.These kinds of love are universal.

                            13. Lesson 3 UNIVERSAL SET AND SUBSETS You have illustrated cardinality of sets. A set may be finite or infinite. It depends on the number of element/s it contain/s. How about if we have a set whose elements are the elements of another set? What do we call this set Can you illustrate subset? Can you illustrate universal set? 1. Objective: After performing the activities here in this lesson, you are expected to illustrate universal set and subset. II. Vocabulary List The universal set, U, is the set that contains all elements under consideration. If all the elements of set A are also elements of set B, then A is a subset of B. This means that subsets can be created from any defined universal set. The set of natural numbers itself is a subset of the set of real numbers, which could be another example of a universal set. Equal sets have the same element, even though they could be out of order. Thus, it has equal cardinality. Equivalent sets have different element but have the same amount of element. Remember: Equal sets are always an equivalent set. Equivalent sets may or may not an equal set. III. Learning Activities A. Most of us love to eat ice cream. Below are the different flavors of ice cream we can choose from.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th century German philosopher, interprets life as amounting to suffering in his work "The World as Will and Representation." He argues that the fundamental aspect of existence is not the rational, conscious self, but rather the underlying will to live, which he refers to as the "will to exist." This will is the source of all suffering, as it drives individuals to constantly seek pleasure and avoid pain, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Schopenhauer believes that the will to exist makes life more insufferable by constantly creating new desires and needs that can never truly be satisfied, resulting in a state of constant dissatisfaction. He states, "Desire is never satisfied by the satisfaction of a desire; indeed, the satisfaction of one desire is but the beginning of another" (Klemke and Cahn, 2017, p.88). He also believes that suffering outweighs pleasure in life because suffering is more intense and longer-lasting than pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Schopenhauer rejects God as a source of meaning in life because he argues that the concept of God only serves to perpetuate the cycle of suffering caused by the will to exist. He states, "If God were to grant us all our desires and needs, we would only desire for more and greater things" (Klemke and Cahn, 2017, p.89). He also argues that love is not capable of providing meaning because it is ultimately driven by the will to exist and therefore leads to suffering.</p><p></p><p>Despite his assertion that life is meaningless, Schopenhauer does not advocate for suicide as an appropriate choice. Instead, he advises individuals to detach themselves from their desires and needs in order to find peace and contentment. He suggests that individuals should focus on cultivating a sense of detachment and detachment from the will to exist, which he believes can lead to a state of contentment and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>However, one could argue that Schopenhauer's views are overly pessimistic and fail to take into account the positive aspects of life such as love, joy, and compassion. Additionally, his emphasis on detachment and denial of desires can be seen as a rejection of human nature and a failure to fully engage with the world.</p><p></p><p>Personally, while I acknowledge the validity of Schopenhauer's argument that suffering is an inherent part of the human experience, I believe that it is important to also recognize and appreciate the positive aspects of life. Therefore, I do not fully agree with his views.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Schopenhauer's interpretation of life as amounting to suffering is rooted in his belief that the fundamental aspect of existence is the will to live, which drives individuals to constantly seek pleasure and avoid pain, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and disappointment. He rejects God and love as sources of meaning in life and instead advises individuals to detach themselves from their desires and needs in order to find peace and contentment. However, his views have been criticized for being overly pessimistic and for rejecting human nature.</p><br />

Some people have a hard time remembering to get their loved one’s appropriate gifts on Valentine’s Day. This can lead to painfully long talks about “where the relationship stands”. Perhaps the best way to avoid these talks is by taking the moral highroad. Instead of forgetting these holidays, choose not to celebrate them. Inform your loved one that you don’t want to buy into the materialism and commercialism of these manufactured holidays. Tell that person that you want to have a relationship with them, not the marketers, and that you want to celebrate your love every day, not just one day a year. It’s a tough pitch, but if you can make the sale then you’ll be in the clear for life.

8. An appropriate title: ____________________________________________________________________________
Sir Isaac Newton was contemplating the universe in his garden one day in 1665 when he noticed an apple fall from a tree. Newton wondered to himself, “Why should the apple always fall to the ground? Why does it not go sideways or upwards but directly toward the Earth’s center?” After much contemplation, Newton concluded that objects are pulled to the Earth through a force that he called gravity, which means heaviness in Latin. On July 5th, 1687 Newton formally expressed his law of universal gravitation in a series of books called The Principia.
