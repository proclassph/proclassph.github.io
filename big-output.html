We need knowledge and skills for both our personal and professional development, which is why education is crucial. I intend to finish my degree program in the following three years, acquire real-world experience through internships, and take part in extracurricular activities to hone my leadership and people skills.A better job is my secondary goal. A job serves as a gateway for career progression and provides stable employment. I want to attend job fairs, look for employment in my field of study, network with business owners, and apply for those I find. I also want to improve my interviewing skills and resume in order to increase my chances of landing a good job.The third goal I have is to start my own company. Entrepreneurship has allowed me to generate something useful and be my own boss. Over the next three years, I plan to select a viable company idea, conduct market research, create a business plan, and seek funding to launch my venture. I also want to network with other businesspeople and attend business conferences to expand my knowledge and entrepreneurial skills.Conclusion:In conclusion, achieving success in life requires setting goals. I intend to accomplish three things over the next three years: finish my college education; find a better job; and launch my own business. But I'm committed to achieving these goals, and I believe I can do so if I put in the necessary effort, maintain my focus, and have a positive mindset.<p>For additional information please open the link: brainly.ph/question/11845739</p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
