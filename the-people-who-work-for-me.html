I just want to work and be busy" And they responded, "ok, it's your responsibility, but do not expect me to give you anything in return" This guy came and worked hard, he was the first to arrive and the last to leaveHe was the best employee in the place At 4 weeks one of the managers above resigned And they were looking for a replacement, guess who they chose? This guy, this person who volunteered his time He got the job What was the difference between the two friends? Sight and vision Vista means judging based on what you seeJudge based on appearances But vision means how you interpret what you see The first guy said: "It's not possible, it's over, it's over, I can not do it, I can not do it" He gave up "I faced rejection over and over and over again, I'm not going to go anymore, there's no work" But this other guy, he felt that despite the "NO" and the rejections, despite the bad economy, despite what the newspapers say believe that it is possibleThat someone somewhere will give him work He went ahead thinking it was possible And guess what ladies and gentlemen, that's what we have to do with our dreams Because things happen in our lives that we never but never can anticipate and when those things happen, you want to give up Never let anyone tell you you can not do something​</a>
