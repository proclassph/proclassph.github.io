                                            Hating Kapatid By: Raissa Rivera Falgui Hating Kapatid My big brother and I come home from school together. A delicious snack always awaits us at home. Today, it's Bibingka that Nanay bought for us Yummy! Nanay kissed us and told us to sit down." You're in charge of dividing the food", she told my brother, "and remember share like brother and sister." The bibingka was cut into four. My brother got three pieces while I got one. "I'm bigger and hungrier. I need more food." He's really bigger than me so I didn't say anything Once, Nanay made fried bananas I helped her cut four bananas in half before she cooked them, so there were eight pieces. My brother got six. "This is how to share like brother and sister", he told me The same thing happened when Tatay brought home our favorite buko pie. When Nanay made a cake and when we had a dozen little rice cakes for our meryenda if someone gave us a mountain of candy, I bet I would only get two or three pieces. My classmate Dina is better off. She has no brothers or sisters. She doesn't have to share anything. If she wanted to. she could eat a whole bibingka or buko pie or cake! But one day, Dina had nothing to eat. She forgot her food at home. "Would you like half of my sandwich?" I offered. I divided it carefully and gave her half. "You did that so carefully. It looks like we are sharing like sisters"." Oh no, both halves are exactly the same," I said. I don't think Dina knows how brothers and sisters share. After all, she doesn't have any. Once, Dina invited me to her house "I have no one to play with at home", she said. We had fun playing hopscotch in front of her house. When her daddy come, he had mamon with him. "Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest. The two of you can just share it." He said. "You divide it. Let's share it like sisters." Dina said. I think she doesn't know how sisters are supposed to share! But how do we do it? We are the same age. We are the same height (she's just a little bit chubbier). "Let's not share like sister" I said. "We're friends. Let's share like friends. "Dina laughed. "What do you mean? Here, let's just do this. You divide it, and I'll choose which half I want. "My hands shook as I carefully divided the mamon in half. Dina looked at the pieces. "It looks like they are the same. So, sharing like sisters is the same as sharing like friends." Then her mommy came home. "Have you had your meryenda?" she asked as she brought out her present-sapin sapin! I had to go home already, so she put sapin-sapin in a small bilao and gave it to me. Tatay was not yet home when I arrived. Nanay was cooking dinner. My brother looked hungry because he was waiting at the dining table. I placed the sapin-sapin in the middle of the table. "Let's share," I said. I got a knife and cut the sapin-sapin in half. Then I cut in half again. "Here, Kuya" I said and gave him one piece. "My friend Dina told me that's how brother and sister are supposed to share. "His eyes grew round, and his face turned red. "Your friend is right, that's how brother and sister are supposed to share," he said in a small voice. I felt like I was bigger and older than my brother. "Maybe we should just share like family," I said. I set aside one piece. "This is for Nanay. "And this is for Tatay" he said. I felt happy because everyone got to try sapin-sapin. It made me happy to make my family happy.​</a>

                                            Love and Time (1.)Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness. Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day, it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love. Love was the only who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. (2.) Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, "Richness, can you take me with you?' Richness answered, "No, I can't. there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place for you here." (3.) Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. "Vanity, please help me.!" I can't help you Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered. (4.) Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, let me go with you." "Oh... Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!" (5.) Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice. "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. Wh they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed elder, Love asked knowledge, another elder, "Who helped me?" "It was Time," know ne help me?"​</a>

                                            all of my siblings and parents are homophobic, and being the youngest daughter I'm lesbian but they don't know that i like girls. A news showed in our T.V of a married lesbians couple, and i saw how my father reacts, and he even cursed the couples saying that they are idiots because they are both girls. I am deeply hurt at that time but i didn't say anything and choose to be quite. I'm very scared how will they going to react if they'll going to find out that i like the same gender (girlXgirl). And also, my mother shared a story about her co-teacher being lesbian, that teacher has a relationship with a girl but a few years, she broke up with her girlfried and choosed to marry a man, and i ask my mother why they both broke up, and she said that its not good being in a relationship with the same gender according to Bible, but i also said that it doesn't matter if you love each others even your same gender, but she disagreed at my statement and i ask her once again if she's homophobic,but she didn't answer my question. Instead of answering my question she said that she silently DISGUSTED to her co-teacher because she loved the same gender, and once i heard what she say, i already know that she's homophobic. I feel very very bad for my self and im scared already to love someone because of them. SHOULD I TAKE THE RISK LOVING SOMEONE IN SAME GENDER OR JUST LET IT GO AND LOVE A MAN? i'm having a lot of problem into these days but no one can even help me, even my own family can't help me.this is not a part of my school work but im just sharing my problems in here, cause why not?:)​</a>

The Frog and the Mouse by Aesop Fables Once upon a time, a mouse and a frog were close friends. The frog often visited the mouse at his home and they both shared the food and provisions the mouse has stocked in abundance. One day, the frog invited the mouse to his house. "Dear Mouse, I come to your house all the time. Now, I invited you to mine!" "I would love to my dear friend, but your house is across the stream, I don't know how to swim, and I am afraid I will drown, the mouse replied. "Don't worry, I have a plan. You can climb on my back and can tie you to me with strong blade of glass. That way, you will be safe to cross the stream," said the frog. To this, the mouse immediately agreed, and they set forth. Halfway across the stream, however, the frog started to get wicked thoughts. "If I were to let the mouse drown, I can get all his food stock and never have worry about being hungry for a long, long time!" the frog thought. So, the wicked frog, dive from the bottom of the stream. The mouse realizing too late the betrayal of the frog and started to cry for help. "Help me! Help me!" cried the mouse. A hawk flying above the stream saw the scene and swooped down upon the mouse. The hawk picked him up with its beak and started to fly high into the sky. The frog tied to the mouse was also taken away. The frog realized his mistake. In his greed to get more food, he had not lost only his good friend, but also put his own life into danger.Questions:11. who is the protagonist?12. who is the antagonist in the story?13. where is the setting?14. what is the story plot?15. what is the rising action?Answer my questions please...ibrabrainlest ko po yung makakasagot...thank you​</a>

                            14. Hating Kapatid By: Raissa Rivera Falgui Hating Kapatid My big brother and I come home from school together. A delicious snack always awaits us at home. Today, it's Bibingka that Nanay bought for us Yummy! Nanay kissed us and told us to sit down." You're in charge of dividing the food", she told my brother, "and remember share like brother and sister." The bibingka was cut into four. My brother got three pieces while I got one. "I'm bigger and hungrier. I need more food." He's really bigger than me so I didn't say anything Once, Nanay made fried bananas I helped her cut four bananas in half before she cooked them, so there were eight pieces. My brother got six. "This is how to share like brother and sister", he told me The same thing happened when Tatay brought home our favorite buko pie. When Nanay made a cake and when we had a dozen little rice cakes for our meryenda if someone gave us a mountain of candy, I bet I would only get two or three pieces. My classmate Dina is better off. She has no brothers or sisters. She doesn't have to share anything. If she wanted to. she could eat a whole bibingka or buko pie or cake! But one day, Dina had nothing to eat. She forgot her food at home. "Would you like half of my sandwich?" I offered. I divided it carefully and gave her half. "You did that so carefully. It looks like we are sharing like sisters"." Oh no, both halves are exactly the same," I said. I don't think Dina knows how brothers and sisters share. After all, she doesn't have any. Once, Dina invited me to her house "I have no one to play with at home", she said. We had fun playing hopscotch in front of her house. When her daddy come, he had mamon with him. "Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest. The two of you can just share it." He said. "You divide it. Let's share it like sisters." Dina said. I think she doesn't know how sisters are supposed to share! But how do we do it? We are the same age. We are the same height (she's just a little bit chubbier). "Let's not share like sister" I said. "We're friends. Let's share like friends. "Dina laughed. "What do you mean? Here, let's just do this. You divide it, and I'll choose which half I want. "My hands shook as I carefully divided the mamon in half. Dina looked at the pieces. "It looks like they are the same. So, sharing like sisters is the same as sharing like friends." Then her mommy came home. "Have you had your meryenda?" she asked as she brought out her present-sapin sapin! I had to go home already, so she put sapin-sapin in a small bilao and gave it to me. Tatay was not yet home when I arrived. Nanay was cooking dinner. My brother looked hungry because he was waiting at the dining table. I placed the sapin-sapin in the middle of the table. "Let's share," I said. I got a knife and cut the sapin-sapin in half. Then I cut in half again. "Here, Kuya" I said and gave him one piece. "My friend Dina told me that's how brother and sister are supposed to share. "His eyes grew round, and his face turned red. "Your friend is right, that's how brother and sister are supposed to share," he said in a small voice. I felt like I was bigger and older than my brother. "Maybe we should just share like family," I said. I set aside one piece. "This is for Nanay. "And this is for Tatay" he said. I felt happy because everyone got to try sapin-sapin. It made me happy to make my family happy.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story "Hating Kapatid" by Raissa Rivera Falgui is about a young girl who struggles with sharing with her big brother. She feels that her brother always gets more food and treats than she does, and she wishes she didn't have to share with him. However, when she makes a new friend who doesn't have any siblings, she realizes the importance of sharing and being kind to others. She eventually learns to share with her brother and her family, and finds happiness in making others happy.</p><p></p><p>The story highlights the importance of sharing and kindness, especially within families. It also shows how we can learn from others and grow as individuals by being open to new experiences and perspectives.</p><br />

                            16. Love and Time (1.)Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness. Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day, it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love. Love was the only who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. (2.) Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, "Richness, can you take me with you?' Richness answered, "No, I can't. there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place for you here." (3.) Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. "Vanity, please help me.!" I can't help you Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered. (4.) Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, let me go with you." "Oh... Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!" (5.) Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice. "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. Wh they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed elder, Love asked knowledge, another elder, "Who helped me?" "It was Time," know ne help me?"​</h2><br />

                            19. all of my siblings and parents are homophobic, and being the youngest daughter I'm lesbian but they don't know that i like girls. A news showed in our T.V of a married lesbians couple, and i saw how my father reacts, and he even cursed the couples saying that they are idiots because they are both girls. I am deeply hurt at that time but i didn't say anything and choose to be quite. I'm very scared how will they going to react if they'll going to find out that i like the same gender (girlXgirl). And also, my mother shared a story about her co-teacher being lesbian, that teacher has a relationship with a girl but a few years, she broke up with her girlfried and choosed to marry a man, and i ask my mother why they both broke up, and she said that its not good being in a relationship with the same gender according to Bible, but i also said that it doesn't matter if you love each others even your same gender, but she disagreed at my statement and i ask her once again if she's homophobic,but she didn't answer my question. Instead of answering my question she said that she silently DISGUSTED to her co-teacher because she loved the same gender, and once i heard what she say, i already know that she's homophobic. I feel very very bad for my self and im scared already to love someone because of them. SHOULD I TAKE THE RISK LOVING SOMEONE IN SAME GENDER OR JUST LET IT GO AND LOVE A MAN? i'm having a lot of problem into these days but no one can even help me, even my own family can't help me.this is not a part of my school work but im just sharing my problems in here, cause why not?:)​</h2><br />

The Frog and the Mouse by Aesop Fables Once upon a time, a mouse and a frog were close friends. The frog often visited the mouse at his home and they both shared the food and provisions the mouse has stocked in abundance. One day, the frog invited the mouse to his house. "Dear Mouse, I come to your house all the time. Now, I invited you to mine!" "I would love to my dear friend, but your house is across the stream, I don't know how to swim, and I am afraid I will drown, the mouse replied. "Don't worry, I have a plan. You can climb on my back and can tie you to me with strong blade of glass. That way, you will be safe to cross the stream," said the frog. To this, the mouse immediately agreed, and they set forth. Halfway across the stream, however, the frog started to get wicked thoughts. "If I were to let the mouse drown, I can get all his food stock and never have worry about being hungry for a long, long time!" the frog thought. So, the wicked frog, dive from the bottom of the stream. The mouse realizing too late the betrayal of the frog and started to cry for help. "Help me! Help me!" cried the mouse. A hawk flying above the stream saw the scene and swooped down upon the mouse. The hawk picked him up with its beak and started to fly high into the sky. The frog tied to the mouse was also taken away. The frog realized his mistake. In his greed to get more food, he had not lost only his good friend, but also put his own life into danger.Questions:11. who is the protagonist?12. who is the antagonist in the story?13. where is the setting?14. what is the story plot?15. what is the rising action?Answer my questions please...ibrabrainlest ko po yung makakasagot...thank you​</h2><br />
