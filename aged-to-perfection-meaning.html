                                            Exercise 5. Read the excerpt and do the activities that follow. I am Juan Picas, born half of myself. I had only one eye, one ear, one arm, one leg, one half of a body. My mother wept when she saw me, but loved me as I grew up and never regarded me as abnormal. My father, too, must have wept although he never spoke of this. He also took me as I was and loved me as much as he knew how. I grew in their care; I thrived in their love. As far as I knew I was entire, I thought myself whole. Like all babies, I learned first to smile, and then to coo, to babble, and to know my mother and father, too. I learned to crawl, and sit up and, in time, to doodle. I learned to speak but even before that, I learned to laugh. My mother taught me how to laugh, perhaps even before I learned to cry. She showered me with good cheer, constant delight. She taught me how to sing. My father taught me how to see. The birds of the sky, the trees, the flowers that grew, the rains that fell and the winds that roared in the night – these my father spoke of and made me see how perfect they fitted into our world and made it as lovely as can be. My father also spoke of people, saying that they are on this earth and living this life as a test. All that matters is a life spent doing good. A man should apply his days in work and by his hands hone his heart in service to God and his fellowmen. Less than his intent and in labor done, a man’s days are but in vain. My father said this, and I realized how he directed his days and wished my life to be. My father often spoke of God as did my mother. The father in Heaven who made us and whose love will keep us alive. God orders our days from our birth, through our youth and manhood, through age and through death and after life. He has the whole world in His hands, rules the beatings of our hearts, knows the number of our hair, and loves us in everything whether good or ill befalls us. All of life’s road lead to him; and answers to life’s questions lie in Him. The meaning of life is with Him. My father and mother taught me this and I learned it. So I grew, a happy child swathed in kindness. My parents sheltered me and kept me away from prying eyes. I did not know harshness, cruelty, even less, until as a frisky boy I set to explore the world on my own. When ridicule sprang, I was bewildered, and asked my parents why other children laughed and poked fun at me. Use the graphic organizer to find out the meaning of the words found in the selection.

                                            The Gift of the Magi
O. Henry
The story opens with $1.87. That's all Della Dillingham Young has to buy a present for her beloved husband, Jim. And the next day is Christmas. Faced with such a situation, Della promptly bursts into tears on the couch, which gives the narrator the opportunity to tell us a bit more about the situation of Jim and Della. The short of it is they live in a shabby flat and they're poor. But they love each other. Once Della's recovered herself, she goes to a mirror to let down her hair and examine it. Della's beautiful, brown, knee-length hair is one of the two great treasures of the poor couple. The other is Jim's gold watch. Her hair examined, Della puts it back up, sheds a tear, and bundles up to head out into the cold. She leaves the flat and walks to Madame Sofronie's hair goods shop, where she sells her hair for twenty bucks. Now she has $21.87 cents. With her new funds, Della is able to find Jim the perfect present: an elegant platinum watch chain for his watch. It's $21, and she buys it. Excited by her gift, Della returns home and tries to make her now-short hair presentable (with a curling iron). She's not convinced Jim will approve, but she did what she had to do to get him a good present. When she finishes with her hair, she gets to work preparing coffee and dinner. Jim arrives at 7pm to find Della waiting by the door and stares fixedly at her, not able to understand that Della's hair is gone. Della can't understand quite what his reaction means. After a little while, Jim snaps out of it and gives Della her present, explaining that his reaction will make sense when she opens it. Della opens it and cries out in joy, only to burst into tears immediately afterward. Jim has given her the set of fancy combs she's wanted for ages, only now she has no hair for them. Jim nurses Della out of her sobs. Once she's recovered she gives Jim his present, holding out the watch chain. Jim smiles, falling back on the couch. He sold his watch to buy Della's combs, he explains. He recommends they put away their presents and have dinner. As they do so, the narrator brings the story to a close by pronouncing that Della and Jim are the wisest of everyone who gives gifts. They are the magi.
Analytical Questions:
1. Does the story end the way that you expect? Why or why not?
2. What aspects of the story would be revealed or hidden if it were told from another point of view? For instance, how would the story change if it were told completely from Jim’s perspective?
3. How would the story change if the setting were different? Would this be an effective story if it were set in today’s time?
4. Pretend that Jim sold his gold watch in a newspaper ad instead. Write the newspaper ad for Jim’s gold watch. What details would he include? Would he divulge the reasoning behind him selling his possession?
5. If Della had had short hair in the beginning of the story, what do you think that she would have done/sold in order to pay for the gold chain? Why do you think so?</a>

                            4. Exercise 5. Read the excerpt and do the activities that follow. I am Juan Picas, born half of myself. I had only one eye, one ear, one arm, one leg, one half of a body. My mother wept when she saw me, but loved me as I grew up and never regarded me as abnormal. My father, too, must have wept although he never spoke of this. He also took me as I was and loved me as much as he knew how. I grew in their care; I thrived in their love. As far as I knew I was entire, I thought myself whole. Like all babies, I learned first to smile, and then to coo, to babble, and to know my mother and father, too. I learned to crawl, and sit up and, in time, to doodle. I learned to speak but even before that, I learned to laugh. My mother taught me how to laugh, perhaps even before I learned to cry. She showered me with good cheer, constant delight. She taught me how to sing. My father taught me how to see. The birds of the sky, the trees, the flowers that grew, the rains that fell and the winds that roared in the night – these my father spoke of and made me see how perfect they fitted into our world and made it as lovely as can be. My father also spoke of people, saying that they are on this earth and living this life as a test. All that matters is a life spent doing good. A man should apply his days in work and by his hands hone his heart in service to God and his fellowmen. Less than his intent and in labor done, a man’s days are but in vain. My father said this, and I realized how he directed his days and wished my life to be. My father often spoke of God as did my mother. The father in Heaven who made us and whose love will keep us alive. God orders our days from our birth, through our youth and manhood, through age and through death and after life. He has the whole world in His hands, rules the beatings of our hearts, knows the number of our hair, and loves us in everything whether good or ill befalls us. All of life’s road lead to him; and answers to life’s questions lie in Him. The meaning of life is with Him. My father and mother taught me this and I learned it. So I grew, a happy child swathed in kindness. My parents sheltered me and kept me away from prying eyes. I did not know harshness, cruelty, even less, until as a frisky boy I set to explore the world on my own. When ridicule sprang, I was bewildered, and asked my parents why other children laughed and poked fun at me. Use the graphic organizer to find out the meaning of the words found in the selection.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I can help you with this problem. I assume you want to find the ages of S and C in terms of x, where x is the common factor of their ages. To do this, we need to use the ratio and the given information. Let’s write the ratio as:</p><p></p><p>S/C = 3/2</p><p></p><p>This means that S is 3 times some number x, and C is 2 times some number x. So we can write:</p><p></p><p>S = 3x C = 2x</p><p></p><p>Now, we are given that five years later, the sum of their ages will be 40. That means:</p><p></p><p>(S + 5) + (C + 5) = 40</p><p></p><p>Substituting S and C with 3x and 2x, we get:</p><p></p><p>(3x + 5) + (2x + 5) = 40</p><p></p><p>Simplifying and solving for x, we get:</p><p></p><p>5x + 10 = 40 5x = 30 x = 6</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the value of x is 6. To find the ages of S and C, we just need to plug in x into the expressions for S and C:</p><p></p><p>S = 3x = 3 × 6 = 18 C = 2x = 2 × 6 = 12</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the age of S is 18 years and the age of C is 12 years.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            9. The Gift of the Magi
O. Henry
The story opens with $1.87. That's all Della Dillingham Young has to buy a present for her beloved husband, Jim. And the next day is Christmas. Faced with such a situation, Della promptly bursts into tears on the couch, which gives the narrator the opportunity to tell us a bit more about the situation of Jim and Della. The short of it is they live in a shabby flat and they're poor. But they love each other. Once Della's recovered herself, she goes to a mirror to let down her hair and examine it. Della's beautiful, brown, knee-length hair is one of the two great treasures of the poor couple. The other is Jim's gold watch. Her hair examined, Della puts it back up, sheds a tear, and bundles up to head out into the cold. She leaves the flat and walks to Madame Sofronie's hair goods shop, where she sells her hair for twenty bucks. Now she has $21.87 cents. With her new funds, Della is able to find Jim the perfect present: an elegant platinum watch chain for his watch. It's $21, and she buys it. Excited by her gift, Della returns home and tries to make her now-short hair presentable (with a curling iron). She's not convinced Jim will approve, but she did what she had to do to get him a good present. When she finishes with her hair, she gets to work preparing coffee and dinner. Jim arrives at 7pm to find Della waiting by the door and stares fixedly at her, not able to understand that Della's hair is gone. Della can't understand quite what his reaction means. After a little while, Jim snaps out of it and gives Della her present, explaining that his reaction will make sense when she opens it. Della opens it and cries out in joy, only to burst into tears immediately afterward. Jim has given her the set of fancy combs she's wanted for ages, only now she has no hair for them. Jim nurses Della out of her sobs. Once she's recovered she gives Jim his present, holding out the watch chain. Jim smiles, falling back on the couch. He sold his watch to buy Della's combs, he explains. He recommends they put away their presents and have dinner. As they do so, the narrator brings the story to a close by pronouncing that Della and Jim are the wisest of everyone who gives gifts. They are the magi.
Analytical Questions:
1. Does the story end the way that you expect? Why or why not?
2. What aspects of the story would be revealed or hidden if it were told from another point of view? For instance, how would the story change if it were told completely from Jim’s perspective?
3. How would the story change if the setting were different? Would this be an effective story if it were set in today’s time?
4. Pretend that Jim sold his gold watch in a newspaper ad instead. Write the newspaper ad for Jim’s gold watch. What details would he include? Would he divulge the reasoning behind him selling his possession?
5. If Della had had short hair in the beginning of the story, what do you think that she would have done/sold in order to pay for the gold chain? Why do you think so?</h2><br />
