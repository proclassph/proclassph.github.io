2. A Mathematics teacher in senior high school developed a problem-solving test for randomly selected 40 grade 11 students. These students had an average score of 85 and a standard deviation of 5. If the population had a mean score of 90 and a standard deviation of 3, use 5% level of significance to test the hypothesis. 
3. A kinder teacher developed a coloring worksheet for her pupils. Using this worksheet, the pupils’ performance has a mean score of 90 and a standard deviation of 10. Fifty kinder pupils from a certain barangay were asked to answer the said worksheet and found that their mean score was 95 with a standard deviation of 5. Test the hypothesis at 1% significance level.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. In this case, two instances may happen if there is a negative correlation: </p><p>a. High income, low incidence of dropouts</p><p>b. Low income, high incidence of dropouts</p><p>Based on this relationship, we can assume that being poor leads to poor performance in school.
