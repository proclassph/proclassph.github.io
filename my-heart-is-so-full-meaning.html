                                            Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</a>

FlavierIt all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism.The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</a>

A Glass of Milk 
A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?."
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart."
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness.
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room.
He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all.
Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

A Glass Of Milk 
A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?." 
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart." 
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness. 
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. He recognized her at once. 
He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

Flavier It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism. The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</a>

As a result, he sent out a terrible orderThe whole area was told to put all the old people to deathThis order led to terrible times. Many people simply abandoned theirold people to die. The poor farmer who lived at the bottom of themountain was very upset He dearly loved his mother and the orderof the wicked ruler. So, he tried to find the kindest way to put his mothercaused him great pain. But no one had ever dared to disobey the orderunwhitened rice. This was the main food for people like him and hisAt the end of the day, with his work completed, the farmer took somemother. He cooked it, dried it, and tied it up in a square cloth. He thenswung it in a bundle over his shoulder, along with a pitcher filled withto deathcool water. Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders. Then, with tears in his eyes and pain in his heart, he saidgoodbyeThe old mother gave a last piece of advice to her son. Her voice wastrembling with unselfish love. She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain. The weight seemed light to him now and he was able to makeit through the shadows and the moonlight down to their little hut. Underthe kitchen floor was a hidden basement where food was stored Theson hid his mother in there. He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order. This one was extremely unreasonable Hewanted his people to give him a gift of a rope made of ashesEveryone was in fear. The order had to be obeyed, yet no one in allof Shining knew how to make a rope of ashes. Then, one night, the sontold his mother about the new order from the ruler. Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time. Finally, helifted his head and said, "Shining needs more than strength and youthI forgot the old saying.

                            2. Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Well For me it's definitely Ki because even though unarmed and with a bad foot condition his ready to save/, sacrifice himself for his wife.</p><br />

A Glass of Milk 
A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?."
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart."
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness.
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room.
He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all.
Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The Parable of the Rainbow Colors, written by Juan M. Flavier, is a short story that depicts a quarrel among different colors, each claiming to be the best. However, their dispute is interrupted by the rain, which teaches them a valuable lesson of cooperation and hope. In this critique, I will analyze the story's strengths and weaknesses, focusing on its theme, characters, and plot.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>The story's strength lies in its theme of cooperation and hope. The rain's intervention serves as a reminder to the colors that they need to work together to create something beautiful. The rainbow, which symbolizes unity and diversity, represents the idea that everyone has a unique role to play in the world. This theme is particularly relevant in today's world, where people often divide themselves into factions based on race, religion, or political beliefs. The story's message is clear: we need to learn to work together, despite our differences, to create a better world.</p><p></p><p>However, the story's characters are somewhat one-dimensional. The colors are defined solely by their attributes, such as red representing courage, yellow representing warmth, and green representing life. While this is a clever way of introducing the characters, it doesn't leave much room for character development. Additionally, the colors' argumentative nature feels forced, as if they were only created to serve the story's purpose rather than having a natural motivation to argue with one another.</p><p></p><p>The story's plot is simple and effective, but it lacks depth. The argument between the colors is resolved quickly, and the story ends with a simple solution. While this is suitable for a parable, it would have been nice to see a more nuanced resolution. The story could have explored the colors' individual strengths and weaknesses, and how they can be combined to create something even more beautiful than a rainbow.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The Parable of the Rainbow Colors is a simple but effective story with a powerful message of cooperation and hope. While the characters and plot could have been more developed, the story succeeds in conveying its theme to readers. Overall, the story serves as a reminder that we need to work together to create a better world, despite our differences.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders. Then, with tears in his eyes and pain in his heart, he saidgoodbyeThe old mother gave a last piece of advice to her son. Her voice wastrembling with unselfish love. She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain.

He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order.

Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time.

However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?." "You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart." Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all.
