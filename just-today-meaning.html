                                            Select the correct text in the passage.Which sentence reflects the central idea of the passage? Experimentation on animals is cruel and unnecessary. It is wrong to test drugs and products on animals. Just because animals cannot speak, it does not mean they do not feel any pain or discomfort. Also, there is no guarantee that what is safe for animals will be safe for humans. However, these experiments still continue. In today’s world, where science has come so far in what it can do, there has to be a better way to test products. One promising new method involves testing on cells in labs rather than testing on living, breathing animals.////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////im in plato right now secretly doing this so pls hurry</a>

I want to thank my (family, parents, brothers, sisters), for making this party possible, for helping me so much in all the preparations, couldn't have done it without you guys! You had such great ideas and it sounded like such a big deal to organize in the beginning, but we all did our parts and it came together really nicely! So, that's it from me and I hope that you all really enjoy (tonight today) as much as I do! Thank you 1. Pick out the words that are used to connect the sentences 2.

It is wrong to test drugs and products on animals. Just because animals cannot speak, it does not mean they do not feel any pain or discomfort. Also, there is no guarantee that what is safe for animals will be safe for humans. However, these experiments still continue. In today’s world, where science has come so far in what it can do, there has to be a better way to test products. One promising new method involves testing on cells in labs rather than testing on living, breathing animals.////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////im in plato right now secretly doing this so pls hurry</h2><br />
