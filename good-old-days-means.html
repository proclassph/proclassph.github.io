Sure, will take you there in plenty good time for your meeting, madam. This way better, less traffic, less car jams. Half hour shouldmake it, madam, so not to worry.2 What is it you say, madam? Yes, yes, ha, ha, been taxi man for twenty years now, madam. Long time ago. Singapore not like this so crowded so busy.

People like us, no education, no capital for business, we must sweat to earn money for wife and children.Yes, madam, quite big family--eight children, six sons, two daughters. Big family! Ha! Ha!

Our parents say don't do this, we never do. Otherwise, the cane. My father cane me. I was big enough to be married, and still, got caning. My father he was very strict, and that is good thing for parents to be strict. If not, young boys and girls become very useless. Do not want to study, but run away, and go to night clubs and take drugs and make love. You agree with me madam?6 Today, young people they are very trouble to their parents. Madam, you see this young people over there, outside the coffee house? See what I mean, madam? They are only school boys and school girls, but they act like big shots,Quarter 2 Week 5pending money, smoking, wearing latest fashion, and making love. Ah, Madam, I know, I know! As taximan, I know them and their habits. Madam, you are a teacher, you say?

The day had been hot, but now, with the dusk falling, a pleasant breezehad sprung up and was coming in from the courtyard, along the corridor, and into his cell. The old prison was very much like theones in cowboy movies. The door of his cell, as well as the one at the end of the corridor were steel frames with iron bars less thantwenty centimetres apart; too close for even the thinnest man to squeeze through, but ample for a cat. One could see through thebars, talk with the guards and the prisoners in the other cells, and be disturbed by someone snoring at night, and the barred doorsmade the prison airy.It was much better than the foreign prisons he had read about, with solid doors, peepholes, and electric bulbs burning thewhole night long.

The spaces between the bars were fine, even for the largest cat to pass through, and the door at the end of thecorridor was the same. In the small rectangular cobbled courtyard where they took their daily walks and where they shot condemnedprisoners at dawn, a couple of skinny young trees, hardly more than saplings, grew by the wall on the right, a few of the thinbranches reaching the top of the wall, nothing to support a man, but good enough for a cat. It was not the wall where they shotpeople; that one was opposite it, at right angle to the door. On days following an execution, of which they had heard every wordand shot through the barred doors, walking in a circle during their daily exercise, they would look furtively for traces of blood on​</a>

                                            (THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO).STORY:I was quite happy in my new place, and if there was one thing that I missed it must not be thought I was discontented; all who had to do with me were good and I had a light airy stable and the best of food. What more could I want? Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week, month after month, and no doubt year after year, I must stand up in a stable night and day except when I am wanted, and then I must be just as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years. Straps here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes. Now, I am not complaining, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say that for a young horse full of strength and spirits, who has been used to some large field or plain where he can fling up his head and toss up his tail and gallop away at full speed, then round and back again with a snort to his companions - I say it is hard never to have a bit more liberty to do as you like. Sometimes, when I have had less exercise than usual, Ihave felt so full of life and spring that when John has taken me out to exercise I really could not keep quiet; do what I would, it seemed as if I must jump, or dance, or prance, and many a good shake I know I must have given him, especially at the first; but he was always good and patient.(THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO.)​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A. In my opinion hiding their relationship is not a good action. Why? I did understand that they need to keep their relationship because of their social status difference however if they both love each other truly  they should face the consequences and tell it to their parents, maybe in that way Ricardo's parents will support them if they saw how strong their love. </p><p>B. I can't find any scenario where it was stated that ayana was jealous hihi. </p><p>C. I can't agree with that statement because I do believe that love knows no gender, and social status. Everyone can love who their heart wants, everyone have right to fall in love to someone they truly wants without thinking their life difference as long as they both love each other and didn't disrespect other people. </p><p>D. I think it is normal for a parent to react just like Ricardo's parents  did because they might be worried for Ricardo however it is not reasonable for them to order Ayana to cut ties with Ricardo because Ricardo is not a kid anymore he can decide for his self and Ricardo love Ayana so if they really love their son Ricardo they should support what makes him happy. </p><br />

The day had been hot, but now, with the dusk falling, a pleasant breezehad sprung up and was coming in from the courtyard, along the corridor, and into his cell. The old prison was very much like theones in cowboy movies. The door of his cell, as well as the one at the end of the corridor were steel frames with iron bars less thantwenty centimetres apart; too close for even the thinnest man to squeeze through, but ample for a cat. One could see through thebars, talk with the guards and the prisoners in the other cells, and be disturbed by someone snoring at night, and the barred doorsmade the prison airy.It was much better than the foreign prisons he had read about, with solid doors, peepholes, and electric bulbs burning thewhole night long. Although the local revolution modelled itself on the Russian one to some extent, it did not have the means toimitate Lubyanka. The revolution was also milder in other respects. A political prisoner usually had done something against theregime, be it only grumbling in public. The interrogations were mostly carried out without torture. Although no public or journalistswere admitted to the more serious political trials, the prisoner had the right to defend himself, and, in case of a death sentence -these, unfortunately, were rather common and mostly undeserved - the condemned man had the right to appeal to the President,although in most cases it only delayed the execution by a few days.The prisoner finished his cigarette, put it out in an empty sardine tin which served him as ashtray, sat on his bed, and lookedat the door again. The spaces between the bars were fine, even for the largest cat to pass through, and the door at the end of thecorridor was the same. In the small rectangular cobbled courtyard where they took their daily walks and where they shot condemnedprisoners at dawn, a couple of skinny young trees, hardly more than saplings, grew by the wall on the right, a few of the thinbranches reaching the top of the wall, nothing to support a man, but good enough for a cat. It was not the wall where they shotpeople; that one was opposite it, at right angle to the door. On days following an execution, of which they had heard every wordand shot through the barred doors, walking in a circle during their daily exercise, they would look furtively for traces of blood on​</h2><br />

                            21. (THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO).STORY:I was quite happy in my new place, and if there was one thing that I missed it must not be thought I was discontented; all who had to do with me were good and I had a light airy stable and the best of food. What more could I want? Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week, month after month, and no doubt year after year, I must stand up in a stable night and day except when I am wanted, and then I must be just as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years. Straps here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes. Now, I am not complaining, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say that for a young horse full of strength and spirits, who has been used to some large field or plain where he can fling up his head and toss up his tail and gallop away at full speed, then round and back again with a snort to his companions - I say it is hard never to have a bit more liberty to do as you like. Sometimes, when I have had less exercise than usual, Ihave felt so full of life and spring that when John has taken me out to exercise I really could not keep quiet; do what I would, it seemed as if I must jump, or dance, or prance, and many a good shake I know I must have given him, especially at the first; but he was always good and patient.(THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO.)​</h2><br />
