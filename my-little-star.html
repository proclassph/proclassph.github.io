Serenade
(Harana)
O lamp in the cold night,
You’re as a star in the sky;
O light in the quite night,
Your image, Dear, bringing me pain; ay!
Arise and stir from where you lie
For slumber deep
Open your window and look down at me
That you may know my true pleadings.
Did you think I’m forgetting,
I remember you at night, sleeping;
Flowing tears for my mat,
Sorrow for my pillows.
Hoe pitiless you have been, how merciless!
Mired is the earth with my tears.
Open then, Dear, your little window
And look down at me pleading.

                                            When I was five years old, I took an extreme liking to my sister's toys. It made little difference that I had a trunk overflowing with dolls and toys of my own. Her "big girl” treasures were much easier to break, and much more appealing. Likewise, when I was ten and she was twelve, the earrings and make-up that she was slowly permitted to experiment with held my attention, while my former obsession with catching bugs seemed to be a distant and fading memory.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>4</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is a popular English lullaby. The lyrics are from an early-19th-century English poem by Jane Taylor, "The Star". The poem, which is in couplet form, was first published in 1806 in Rhymes for the Nursery, a collection of poems by Taylor and her sister Ann. It is sung to the tune of the French melody "Ah! vous dirai-je, maman", which was published in 1761 and later arranged by several composers, including Mozart with Twelve Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman".[1] The English lyrics have five stanzas, although only the first is widely known. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 7666. This song is usually performed in the key of C major.</p><br />

Serenade
(Harana)
O lamp in the cold night,
You’re as a star in the sky;
O light in the quite night,
Your image, Dear, bringing me pain; ay!
Arise and stir from where you lie
For slumber deep
Open your window and look down at me
That you may know my true pleadings.
Did you think I’m forgetting,
I remember you at night, sleeping;
Flowing tears for my mat,
Sorrow for my pillows.
Hoe pitiless you have been, how merciless!
Mired is the earth with my tears.
Open then, Dear, your little window
And look down at me pleading.

                            18. When I was five years old, I took an extreme liking to my sister's toys. It made little difference that I had a trunk overflowing with dolls and toys of my own. Her "big girl” treasures were much easier to break, and much more appealing. Likewise, when I was ten and she was twelve, the earrings and make-up that she was slowly permitted to experiment with held my attention, while my former obsession with catching bugs seemed to be a distant and fading memory.
