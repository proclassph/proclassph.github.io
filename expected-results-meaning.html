Overweight people are most like to have serious illnesses such as diabetes and heart diseases which can result in premature death. It is well known that regular exercise can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, which means that those with poor fitness levels are at an increased risk of suffering from those problems. Changes by individuals to their diet and their physical activity can increase life expectancy. They could choose to walk up stairs instead taking the lift. These simple changes could lead to a significant improvement in fitness levels. The paragraph is an example of _________________

This time, your school clinic supervisor tasked you to make in analysis of the mean weight of students. You started with one class of grade 11 students, and collect their weights in kilogram (kg). To select your sample, you write each weight measurement on a slip of paper put the slips into a small bag, mix them up, pick out 5 slips at random, and write down the numbers you picked. You return the slips in the bag and repeat the process until you have 20 samples of 5 numbers. The following will be part of your analysis:a)For each of the samples of weights obtained, compute the resulting point estimate and 95% margin of error for the mean weight of students in the class. b)For each of the 20 samples, construct the resulting 68% confidence interval for the average weight of all the students in the class. c)Compute the mean and standard deviation of the population weights. The important questions you would like to answer are as follows: How many of the 20 confidence intervals would you expect to contain the true mean? • Based from your results, how many actually contain the true mean?

Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) is area in the Northwestern Pacific where Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) agency takes charge of giving information about the coming typhoon, the Philippines' national meteorological agency that monitors weather occurrences. Significant weather disturbances, specifically tropical cyclones, that enter or are given Philippine-specific names. 6.________ is raised to warn the public of incoming weather disturbances. It is raised according to the windspeed and expected time of onset of the wind and rain. 7._________ means winds of 30-60 kph may be expected in at least 36 hours or irregular rains may be expected within 36 hours. 8._________ means winds of greater than 61 kph up to 120 kph may be expected in at least 24 hours. 9.________means winds of greater than 121 kph to 170 kph may be expected in at least 18 hours. 10.________means very strong winds of 171 to 220 kph maybe expected in at least 12 hours. Low pressure is Lower than that surrounding locations. It is where an intense circular storm that originates over warm tropical oceans form and become tropical depression. The Philippines is prone to tropical cyclones due to its geographical location which generally produce heavy rains and flooding of large areas and strong winds which result in heavy casualties to human life and destructions to crops and properties.pls paki answer po ng Tama at matino​ </a>

1. Pie charts are perfect when you want to bring statistics to life.
2. To write a summary of survey results, remember that the introduction needs to
get the reader's attention.
3. Your survey summary should give the reader a complete overview of the
content.
4. Tables are a great way to share numerical data.
5. Avoid combining visuals with text will not create a thorough description of your
findings
6. Conclusion explains the truth--why the hypothesis was accurate or not.
7. Summarize the experiment procedure followed. It should be detailed and
include diagrams to support the procedure whenever possible.
8. Explain the results that were obtained from the project. Describe if they
matched your expectations or not. If the desired results were not obtained, explain how and
why the results are different.
9. You should not assume that your reader has any special knowledge of your
experiment
10. When writing the report of an experiment, it is not necessary that
you include
what is relevant to your problem.
11. Remember that observation is more than just seeing and hearing. You should
use your senses, you will be listening sounds, smelling scents, feeling sensations, watching
scenarios and even tasting food if this applies.
12. Always look for the meaning of the actions you observe.
13. Always put the analysis and interpretations of your observations within the
larger context of the theories and issues you described in the introduction.
14. Explain what observations mean to you and what they might mean to the
potential reader. Combine everything together in a concise paragraph.
15. Do record your observation randomly on what do.</a>

Overweight people are most like to have serious illnesses such as diabetes and heart diseases which can result in premature death. It is well known that regular exercise can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, which means that those with poor fitness levels are at an increased risk of suffering from those problems. Changes by individuals to their diet and their physical activity can increase life expectancy. They could choose to walk up stairs instead taking the lift. These simple changes could lead to a significant improvement in fitness levels. The paragraph is an example of _________________

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> Truth is the aim of belief; falsity is a fault. People need the truth about the world in order to thrive. Truth is important. Believing what is not true is apt to spoil people’s plans and may even cost them their lives. Telling what is not true may result in legal and social penalties. Conversely, a dedicated pursuit of truth characterizes the good scientist, the good historian, and the good detective. So what is truth, that it should have such gravity and such a central place in people’s lives?<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> mark me as brainlist thank you</p><br />

Significant weather disturbances, specifically tropical cyclones, that enter or are given Philippine-specific names. 6.________ is raised to warn the public of incoming weather disturbances. It is raised according to the windspeed and expected time of onset of the wind and rain. 7._________ means winds of 30-60 kph may be expected in at least 36 hours or irregular rains may be expected within 36 hours. 8._________ means winds of greater than 61 kph up to 120 kph may be expected in at least 24 hours. 9.________means winds of greater than 121 kph to 170 kph may be expected in at least 18 hours. 10.________means very strong winds of 171 to 220 kph maybe expected in at least 12 hours.

1. Pie charts are perfect when you want to bring statistics to life.
2. To write a summary of survey results, remember that the introduction needs to
get the reader's attention.
3. Your survey summary should give the reader a complete overview of the
content.
4. Tables are a great way to share numerical data.
5. Avoid combining visuals with text will not create a thorough description of your
findings
6. Conclusion explains the truth--why the hypothesis was accurate or not.
7. Summarize the experiment procedure followed. It should be detailed and
include diagrams to support the procedure whenever possible.
8. Explain the results that were obtained from the project. Describe if they
matched your expectations or not. If the desired results were not obtained, explain how and
why the results are different.
9. You should not assume that your reader has any special knowledge of your
experiment
10. When writing the report of an experiment, it is not necessary that
you include
what is relevant to your problem.
11. Remember that observation is more than just seeing and hearing. You should
use your senses, you will be listening sounds, smelling scents, feeling sensations, watching
scenarios and even tasting food if this applies.
12. Always look for the meaning of the actions you observe.
13. Always put the analysis and interpretations of your observations within the
