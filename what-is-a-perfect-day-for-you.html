The term is used particularly in the context of English grammar to refer to forms like "I have finished".The future perfect is a verb form or construction used to describe an event that is expected or planned to happen before a time of reference in the future, such as will have finished in the English sentence "I will have finished by tomorrow." <p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST!</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Valentine’s Day is an international festival that celebrates the feeling of love. Saint Valentine’s Day is celebrated each year on the 14th February and marks the death anniversary of one of the Christian legends, Saint Valentine. In most of the first world countries, February 14 is considered as a national holiday. Valentine’s Day has especially come to become a day made for lovers. Even in the media, Valentine’s Day is portrayed as a day meant for lovers. However, Valentine’s Day has a much larger appeal.  It is a day to express love and that love can be for anyone and not specially a lover. </p><p></p><p>The festival, which celebrated the coming of spring, included fertility rites and the pairing off of women with men by lottery. At the end of the 5th century, Pope Gelasius I replaced Lupercalia with St. Valentine’s Day. It came to be celebrated as a day of romance from about the 14th century. Valentine's Day is celebrated on Sunday, February 14, 2021. Saint Valentine was a total of 14 saints who laid out their life for Ancient Rome. However, some people believe that the Valentine’s Day is a tribute to only one of these fourteen saints. </p><br />

                        <p>I will have done the ironing by the time you get home. What aspect of the verb is will have done?</p><p> </p><p>A. Simple aspect </p><p>B. Progressive </p><p>C. Perfect </p><p>D. Perfect Progressive</p><p></p><p>Actually, the aspect of the verb will have done is Future Perfect Tense, but Option <strong>C</strong><strong> </strong>is the closest one. It cannot be a simple aspect since we use "will have" It is used to form a Future Perfect Tense. it also cannot be progressive aspect since from the verb itself "done" is already in it's past tense. It cannot be perfect progressive since the formula for perfect progressive is "have/has + been + present participle of the verb" For Example: has been cooking/have been dancing.</p><p></p><p>So the closest answer is <strong>C</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>P</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>t</strong>.
