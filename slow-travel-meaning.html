The magnitude of displacement can be negative or positive. 12. There is an acceleration in an object traveling at constant speed as long as the direction is changing 13. A negative acceleration means that the object is slowing down or come to stop. 14. You are inside a moving car.

Motion is a change in position. 2. The train is accelerating if it is slowing down. 3. Speed is equal to distance multiplied by time. 4. To describe velocity, you need to know speed and direction. 5. Distance is a scalar quantity and displacement is a vector quantity. 6. In daily life, we use the term acceleration for the speeding up objects. 7. If the distance traveled is 100 meters and the time is 50 seconds, the speed is 2 m/s. 8. To calculate the average speed, divide the distance travelled by the time it takes to travel that distance. 9. If the object does not change its position at a given time interval then it is at rest or its speed is zero. 10. The road sign "Speed Limit 60kph" means that a vehicle should travel a distance of 60kph in a period of one hour.​</a>

                                            TRUE OR FALSE 13. Distance gives complete information of the route followed by the body, while displacement does not give complete information of the route followed by the body. 14. Distance is always positive, cannot be negative and zero. 15. The unit used to express speed is meters per second (m/s), it can also be expressed in miles per hour (mi/hr or mph), kilometers per hour (km/hr or kph). 16. In calculating for average speed, you will divide the total distance travelled by the total time travelled. 17. The unit used for velocity is the same as the unit of speed like meter per second, kilometer per hour, and miles per hour. 18. If you are not changing your speed, and you are not changing your direction, then you simply cannot be accelerating, no matter how fast you are going. 19. Time is plotted on the Y-axis, while distance is plotted on the X-axis. 20. A speed-time graph shows how the speed of a moving object changes with time. 21. Speed-time graph is different from velocity-time graph. 22. In a given time, if the distance the object moves is changed (getting larger), it is accelerating. 23. A straight horizontal line on a speed-time graph means that speed is constant. It is not changing over time. Therefore, it has no acceleration. 24. A downward sloping line means that the object is slowing down. 25. A horizontal line means the object is moving at a constant speed with zero acceleration. MIT​</a>

Motion is a change in position. 2. The train is accelerating if it is slowing down. 3. Speed is equal to distance multiplied by time. 4. To describe velocity, you need to know speed and direction. 5. Distance is a scalar quantity and displacement is a vector quantity. 6. In daily life, we use the term acceleration for the speeding up objects. 7. If the distance traveled is 100 meters and the time is 50 seconds, the speed is 2 m/s. 8. To calculate the average speed, divide the distance travelled by the time it takes to travel that distance. 9. If the object does not change its position at a given time interval then it is at rest or its speed is zero. 10. The road sign "Speed Limit 60kph" means that a vehicle should travel a distance of 60kph in a period of one hour.​</h2><br />

                            16. TRUE OR FALSE 13. Distance gives complete information of the route followed by the body, while displacement does not give complete information of the route followed by the body. 14. Distance is always positive, cannot be negative and zero. 15. The unit used to express speed is meters per second (m/s), it can also be expressed in miles per hour (mi/hr or mph), kilometers per hour (km/hr or kph). 16. In calculating for average speed, you will divide the total distance travelled by the total time travelled. 17. The unit used for velocity is the same as the unit of speed like meter per second, kilometer per hour, and miles per hour. 18. If you are not changing your speed, and you are not changing your direction, then you simply cannot be accelerating, no matter how fast you are going. 19. Time is plotted on the Y-axis, while distance is plotted on the X-axis. 20. A speed-time graph shows how the speed of a moving object changes with time. 21. Speed-time graph is different from velocity-time graph. 22. In a given time, if the distance the object moves is changed (getting larger), it is accelerating. 23. A straight horizontal line on a speed-time graph means that speed is constant. It is not changing over time. Therefore, it has no acceleration. 24. A downward sloping line means that the object is slowing down. 25. A horizontal line means the object is moving at a constant speed with zero acceleration. MIT​</h2><br />
