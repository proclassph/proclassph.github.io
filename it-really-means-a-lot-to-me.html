Welcome to My Beautiful Classroom There are lots of reasons why I like my classroom. First, it is really big and roomy. We sit at a rectangle tables that are about six feet by two feet. Since there are four of us sitting on a table, we have lots of room. The chairs are comfortable. They are bright orange and have matching cushion seats and backs. The floor has a light green rug, which means we don't need tennis balls on the chair legs to keep the noise down. The bulletin board are neat. They run all the way to the floor to the ceiling, and our teachers write on them on bright colors. There is a great reading area in the room. It has a blue couch that my teacher said used to be in her house. The couch has four comfy pillows: two red and one yellow and one blue-striped. Next to the couch are lots of books in big, bright-colored baskets, so I never have a problem finding something I like to read. My classroom? It is the best!

"I got a flower" by Paulette kelly
It wasn’t my birthday or any other special day.
We had our first argument last night.
He said a lot of cruel things that really hurt me.
I know he was sorry and didn’t mean the things he said.
Because I got flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t our anniversary or any other special day.
Last night, he threw me into a wall and started to choke me.
It seemed like a nightmare. I couldn’t believe it was real.
I woke up this morning sore and bruised all over. I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t Valentine’s Day or any other special day.
Last night, he beat me up again.
And it was much worse than all other times.
If I leave him, what will I do? How will I take care of my kids? What about money? I’m afraid of him and scared to leave. But I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
Today was a very special day. It was the day of my funeral. Last night he finally killed me. He beat me to death.</a>

I'm not going to make this all long and formal, but I just wanted to thank everyone who came today to celebrate today with me, it means a lot! 20 years old...wow sounds weird to hear myself say it because I don't feel much different than last year but 20 sounds like a grown up so I guess I must be one! I have known many of you for so long and even though a lot of us are all going to school in different places now and have separated over the years, it's great that my birthday got you all back together for this one day! I want to thank my (family, parents, brothers, sisters), for making this party possible, for helping me so much in all the preparations, couldn't have done it without you guys! You had such great ideas and it sounded like such a big deal to organize in the beginning, but we all did our parts and it came together really nicely! So, that's it from me and I hope that you all really enjoy (tonight today) as much as I do! Thank you 1. Pick out the words that are used to connect the sentences 2.

A real leader is someone who has a certain amount of securitywithin himself- can think for himself and can stand on his own feet.If you are goingto be leaders, there are three important things to do. First, be reallyaware of yourselves and what is going on in our country. In spite of differences,you all belong to one nation. Second, develop a sense of commitment to thePhilippines. Commitment means much more than just standing up to the tune ofthe National Anthem. It means contributing something to the progress anddevelopment of the Philippines no matter how small. It means doing your workfaithfullyand well. It also means upholding the ideals and heritage of the Filipinonation. Third, respect each other and work well with each other. You are going tobe leaders of this country, and you are here as individuals sincerely trying todevelop yourselves to understand and commit yourselves to the Philippines, andto get skills of working with large groups.Describe what a Leader is.Describe what a leader is notWhat a leader should doа.Folosdiob.C.What commitment means10- owenisinpostena.b.C.​</a>

                                            how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</a>

Outsourcing.   Changing   Workers’   Attitude   and   Values,Demographics   and   Diversity,   and   Globalization.   It   can   help   me   as   a   Grade   12student because it gave me an insight on what are some ideas that really exist in theworkplaces.2. How will lifelong learning help you in succeeding in life and career?- It helps you a lot by simply helping yourself. Lifelong learning is all on one’sself. So, to say that survival is in each one of us and in our owns, so by you andyourself can do the things that could help thy self in everything in this world. Beingable to change and reflective, and aware of everything and so on, you could helpyourself through lifelong learning.3. Do you agree with Heraclitus when he said, “the only thing that is constant ischange”? Explain.-  Yes,  I  agree.  Everyone   needs  change,  even  if  they  feel  like  they  don’t.Whatever aspect of life it is, still there’s still a need of change. Change cannot begone,   unless   you’re   perfect   in   everything.   There   is   still   a   lot   of   rooms   fordevelopment and improvement in one’s self and other beings, so by that change isconstant.4. How will you implement the seven C’s of lifelong skills in your life and career?- Having this seven C’s in our lives and careers means a lot for us. Thinking ofall the things in life, especially some problems or choices must need the CriticalThinking   and   Doing   lifelong   skill   in   all   times,   plus   Creativity   when   we   applysomething from imagination to reality to either help us or just present your ideas tothe world. And of course you really need to have Collaboration up and running. Youcannot do all things alone and by yourself, you really need to have someone to haveby your side. And as life goes on, you think that you knew everything but no. Youmust   have   an   open   mind   for   everything   that’s   all   about   the   world   and   yoursurroundings. You need to have some Cross-Cultural Understanding in your mindand in your heart. And going back in the Collaboration lifelong skill, you need to notbe alone by having Communication in everything and, as long as possible, everyoneso you won’t be as the world progresses, you need to have your body adapt to the digital world andhave the Computing lifelong skill, because it’s inevitable that the digital age shall runin the world for a long time. And last, you need to have the ability to grow in yourselfright? So implement the Career and Learning Self-Reliance lifelong skill to manageyourself and your life and career in the future.​</a>

First, it is really big and roomy. We sit at a rectangle tables that are about six feet by two feet. Since there are four of us sitting on a table, we have lots of room. The chairs are comfortable. They are bright orange and have matching cushion seats and backs. The floor has a light green rug, which means we don't need tennis balls on the chair legs to keep the noise down. The bulletin board are neat. They run all the way to the floor to the ceiling, and our teachers write on them on bright colors. There is a great reading area in the room. It has a blue couch that my teacher said used to be in her house. The couch has four comfy pillows: two red and one yellow and one blue-striped. Next to the couch are lots of books in big, bright-colored baskets, so I never have a problem finding something I like to read. My classroom? It is the best!

                            9. What message is this poem trying to convey in relation to Love, Intimacy and Commitment?
"I got a flower" by Paulette kelly
It wasn’t my birthday or any other special day.
We had our first argument last night.
He said a lot of cruel things that really hurt me.
I know he was sorry and didn’t mean the things he said.
Because I got flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t our anniversary or any other special day.
Last night, he threw me into a wall and started to choke me.
It seemed like a nightmare. I couldn’t believe it was real.
I woke up this morning sore and bruised all over. I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
It wasn’t Valentine’s Day or any other special day.
Last night, he beat me up again.
And it was much worse than all other times.
If I leave him, what will I do? How will I take care of my kids? What about money? I’m afraid of him and scared to leave. But I know he must be sorry.
Because he sent me flowers today.
I got flowers today.
Today was a very special day. It was the day of my funeral. Last night he finally killed me. He beat me to death.</h2><br />

I'm not going to make this all long and formal, but I just wanted to thank everyone who came today to celebrate today with me, it means a lot! 20 years old...wow sounds weird to hear myself say it because I don't feel much different than last year but 20 sounds like a grown up so I guess I must be one! I have known many of you for so long and even though a lot of us are all going to school in different places now and have separated over the years, it's great that my birthday got you all back together for this one day! I want to thank my (family, parents, brothers, sisters), for making this party possible, for helping me so much in all the preparations, couldn't have done it without you guys! You had such great ideas and it sounded like such a big deal to organize in the beginning, but we all did our parts and it came together really nicely! So, that's it from me and I hope that you all really enjoy (tonight today) as much as I do! Thank you 1. Pick out the words that are used to connect the sentences 2.

                            22. how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</h2><br />
