                                            Supporting Details WorksheetDIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph. Then answer the questions. There are many good reasons to choose a vegan lifestyle. Some people follow a vegan diet for their health. Cutting out consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy - and eating a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, and legumes - can reduce the risk of debilitating "lifestyle" diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, or Alzheimer's. There are also many studies that show that following a vegan diet that is high in fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, and legumes results in a leaner, more energetic body. Others" go vegan" as a way to take a stand for animal rights. Still others object to the way our modem animal agricultural system is contributing to global warming and deforestation, and refuse to buy and eat meat asa matter of protest. Whatever reason vegans find most motivating, veganism has grown 500% since 2014, and there is every indication that it will continue to grow in popularity. 1. What is the paragraph's main idea?3.

                                             Huntington’s disease is a very distressing illness that can be defined according to its genetic basis, symptoms, and treatment. This debilitating disease is inherited. It exerts emotional, social, and psychological pressures. The rapid pace of research, however, and the recent innovations in technology that have allowed scientists to locate and understand the gene responsible for the disease offer great hope for an eventual treatment and, perhaps, a cure. Two lines of research effort are currently being actively pursued. One is directed at the development of drugs that may slow down or stop the progress of the disease; the other focuses on ways to impede or prevent the action of the proteins that cause brain tissue degeneration in the first place.​</a>

                                            What I Have Learned Physical fitness is defined as one's ability to meet the demands of daily life without much effort, and still have enough energy to respond to unexpected difficult situations. It can also be achieved through regular physical activities, proper nutrition, and sufficient rest. Engaging in a physical fitness program provides an individual with immediate and long-term benefits. It reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, controls overweight conditions, lowers hypertension, manages emotional and psychological stress, speeds up rehabilitation from illnesses, and postpones the debilitating effects of ageing. 1. In your own words, explain the importance of physical fitness. 2. Describe the importance of cardio-respiratory endurance.​</a>

At first, the doctors thought he was prone to systemic migraines, but the truth was much worse. Many nights, too many, the little boy would curl up in pain, his teeth clenched in a faux smile. The headaches were excruciating, only soothed by a cold wash cloth, his mother’s gentle voice, and the telling of the quilt’s tale as he drifted off to sleep. There were also many a night where Elise would sit with her son as he slept, meticulously piecing back together the tears that threatened the blanket entirely, wishing there was a way she could also mend her son.Pa sagot po ako kung ano pwede ilagay na resolution sa story nato plsssss para po sa practical namin​</a>

                                            GUYS pa helpThere are many good reasons to choose a vegan lifestyle. Some people follow a vegan diet for their health. Cutting out consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy - and eating a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, and legumes - can reduce the risk of debilitating "life style" diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, or Alzheimer's. There are also many studies that show that following a vegan diet that is high in fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, and legumes results in a leaner, more  energetic body. Others "go vegan" as a way to take a stand for animal rights. Still others object to the way our modem animal agricultural system is contributing to global warming and deforestation, and refuse to buy and eat meat as a matter of protest. Whatever reason vegans find most motivating, veganism has grown 500% since 2014, and there is every indication that it will continue to grow in popularity.​</a>

This debilitating disease is inherited. It exerts emotional, social, and psychological pressures. The rapid pace of research, however, and the recent innovations in technology that have allowed scientists to locate and understand the gene responsible for the disease offer great hope for an eventual treatment and, perhaps, a cure. Two lines of research effort are currently being actively pursued. One is directed at the development of drugs that may slow down or stop the progress of the disease; the other focuses on ways to impede or prevent the action of the proteins that cause brain tissue degeneration in the first place.​</h2><br />

Without sufficient funding, schools may struggle to hire and retain qualified teachers, offer competitive salaries and benefits, and provide necessary instructional materials and facilities.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, funding constraints can limit a school's ability to offer a wide range of programs and services that can enhance the learning experience for students. For example, schools may be unable to offer specialized programs in music, art, or technology if they do not have the resources to hire specialized teachers or purchase necessary equipment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, schools that are underfunded may struggle to maintain their facilities, leading to inadequate learning environments that can negatively impact students' health and well-being. Overall, lack of funding can be a major barrier to providing high-quality education to students, and it is important for policymakers and communities to prioritize investment in education to ensure that all students have access to the resources they need to succeed</p><br />

                            19. What I Have Learned Physical fitness is defined as one's ability to meet the demands of daily life without much effort, and still have enough energy to respond to unexpected difficult situations. It can also be achieved through regular physical activities, proper nutrition, and sufficient rest. Engaging in a physical fitness program provides an individual with immediate and long-term benefits. It reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, controls overweight conditions, lowers hypertension, manages emotional and psychological stress, speeds up rehabilitation from illnesses, and postpones the debilitating effects of ageing. 1. In your own words, explain the importance of physical fitness. 2. Describe the importance of cardio-respiratory endurance.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Physical fitness refers to the ability of your body systems to work together efficiently to allow you to be healthy and perform activities of daily living. They are being efficient means doing daily activities with the least effort possible. A fit person can complete schoolwork, meet home responsibilities, and still have enough energy to enjoy sports and other leisure activities.

At first, the doctors thought he was prone to systemic migraines, but the truth was much worse. Many nights, too many, the little boy would curl up in pain, his teeth clenched in a faux smile. The headaches were excruciating, only soothed by a cold wash cloth, his mother’s gentle voice, and the telling of the quilt’s tale as he drifted off to sleep. There were also many a night where Elise would sit with her son as he slept, meticulously piecing back together the tears that threatened the blanket entirely, wishing there was a way she could also mend her son.Pa sagot po ako kung ano pwede ilagay na resolution sa story nato plsssss para po sa practical namin​</h2><br />

                            29. GUYS pa helpThere are many good reasons to choose a vegan lifestyle. Some people follow a vegan diet for their health. Cutting out consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy - and eating a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, and legumes - can reduce the risk of debilitating "life style" diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, or Alzheimer's. There are also many studies that show that following a vegan diet that is high in fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, and legumes results in a leaner, more  energetic body. Others "go vegan" as a way to take a stand for animal rights. Still others object to the way our modem animal agricultural system is contributing to global warming and deforestation, and refuse to buy and eat meat as a matter of protest. Whatever reason vegans find most motivating, veganism has grown 500% since 2014, and there is every indication that it will continue to grow in popularity.​</h2><br />
