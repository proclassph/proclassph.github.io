The speed of sound is calculated to be 339 m/s. If a sound wave has a frequency of 500 Hz, find the length of the sound wave. 4. Find the speed of sound in air when the temperature of the day is 27°C. 5. Calculate the speed of sound wave in the air when the temperature is 32°C. Well done! You are truly an amazing learner.
