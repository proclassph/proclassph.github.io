                        <p><strong>IS IT TRUE THAT THE EARTH WILL MELT A FEW YEARS FROM NOW?</strong></p><p></p><p>They say the increase in the Earth's surface temperature will trigger a runaway greenhouse effect four billion years from now. By that time, all life on Earth will have died out. This could be the source of rising sea levels, which could force the ocean to submerge all coastal communities. We need to come up with new remedies or strategies to prevent this from happening in the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>RESEARCH QUESTION :</strong></p><p>What can we do to save the earth? What can we do to avert these problems in the future?</p><p></p><p>The study topics may provide further information on how to address the issue and educate others about how their actions impact the environment as it evolves into a major threat in the coming years.</p><p></p><p><strong>METHODS :</strong></p><p>I will use online browsing to gather data from several certified sites on the web in order to obtain solutions to the research questions.</p><p></p><br />
