&quot;Honestly&quot;
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don&#039;t have to say it, I don&#039;t have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you&#039;re still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they&#039;re said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won&#039;t give me some time
To see if everything could work out you&#039;ll be mine
I&#039;ll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I&#039;ve been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you&#039;re still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you&#039;re still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I&#039;m sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you&#039;re still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you&#039;re still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</p>

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</a>

Nolan: I love to eat banana!
Marjun: Really? I thought you love durian?
Nolan: Hmmm. Well, whether banana or durian I would still love it. Fruits are all
 delicious.
Jamaica: You’re right, Nolan. But I would still prefer durian. Durians from Davao are
 the best. How about you Azzyl?
Azzyl: I always like lanzones especially when it is from Camiguin. Lanzones from
 Camiguin are the sweetest.
Jamaica: Really? Maybe next time you should give us some.
Azzyl: Sure.
Marjun: Don’t you love mango? It’s our national fruit. And we have a mango tree in
 our backyard. Mangoes are nutritious and rich in fiber.
Nolan: Wow... You mean it is as sweet as the mangoes in Guimaras?
Marjun: Actually, the seedling came from Guimaras.
Jamaica: I also heard that from my mother. Mangoes from Guimaras are known to
 be sweet and juicy.
Azzyl: Actually, as what our teacher says, all fruits from the Philippines are sweet
 and nutritious.
Nolan: Yes, I agree.</a>

If there is NO topic and concluding sentence, write NONE. 1.Driving under the alcohol influence isn’t a good practice for professional drivers. Nowadays, professional drivers who always find themselves partying till midnight will drive home drunk. Because they are very eager to go home, they will insist that they can drive. After some moments of driving, they will feel sleepy and eventually, they will be vulnerable to accidents and worse, even death. Therefore, it may be a cliché to say but still it is better not to drink and drive! 2.“It’s summertime! No doubt, people are dreaming of the ideal vacation: walking leisurely along the beach, or filling one’s lungs with fresh mountain air; waking up in the morning without being harassed by a list of things to do, or whiling away the hours without guilt or regret. For those with money to spend, the ideal vacation means endless shopping, touring, or partying. For people who are cash-strapped, vacation means staying at home, relishing the company of loved ones, watching TV, reading a book, or rearranging the furniture. For those bent on improving spiritual life, vacation means the time for retreats, recollections, or more intense personal prayers.” 3. Are you in love? Don’t have enough confidence to tell your feelings to someone special to you? Want to say sorry? Just want to request a song? Want to say thank you? Or you just want to say hello to your friends? Well, that is not a problem. Speaker’s bureau dedication booth is here. Let your message accompanied with your favorite song be heard dedicated to your special someone! 4.“I recall that even before I learned how to write my name, I was already into drawing. First, my mother would tell me that she doesn’t know how I learned to draw, every time I ask her. But she remembers that my joy then was to scribble anything that would smear itself on any surface. That meant pencils, chalks, pen, crayons, coloring pencils, even adobe stones and charcoals. Second, I remember too that every time I used these instruments on the wall, paper, floor, fence or pavement, I would always be stopped, scolded, spanked, reprimanded or at the very least, cautioned. But I did really love to see those smear tools do their dirtying job under the whim and every movement of my hand. That, I called drawing.” ​​</a>

The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.
Can you infer where I am?</a>

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive

"To your mother dear,And bring her heart to me.Without another word,Youth left and went to his mother dear.He opened her breast and took her heart!But he did not shed a tear.Then back to his Maiden fair,He run unmindful of the rain.But his feet slipped, And he fell down,And loud, he groaned with pain!Still in his hand he held the prize,That would win his Maiden's hands.But he thought of his mother dear,So kind,so sweet,so fond.And then,he heard a voice!Not from his lips,But all apart!"Get up" it said."Were you hurt,Child?"It was his mother's heartThink it through 1.

"Locked Away"
by R. City feat. Adam Levine
If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
Right about now.
If a judge for life me,
Would you stay by my side?
Or is ya gonna say good-bye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life,
Shorty, would it be alright?
Come and show me that you are down
(ah-ha)
Now tell me would you really ride for me?
(would you really ride for me?)
Baby, tell me would you die for me?
(tell me would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me?
(what's up?)
Would you be there to always hold me down?
Tell me would you really cry for me?
(would you really cry for me?)
Baby, don't lie to me.
(baby, don't lie to me)
If I didn't have anything,
(what's up?)
I wanna know would you stick around?
If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?

                                            The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly

                            4. When I say, “I am a Christian”I’m not shouting, “I’ve been saved!”I’m whispering, “I get lost sometimesThat’s why I chose this way”When I say, “I am a Christian”I don’t speak with human prideI’m confessing that I stumble –needing God to be my guideWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I’m not trying to be strongI’m professing that I’m weakand pray for strength to carry onWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I’m not bragging of successI’m admitting that I’ve failedand cannot ever pay the debtWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I don’t think I know it allI submit to my confusionasking humbly to be taughtWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I’m not claiming to be perfectMy flaws are far too visiblebut God believes I’m worth itWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I still feel the sting of painI have my share of heartachewhich is why I seek God’s nameWhen I say, “I am a Christian”I do not wish to judgeI have no authorityI only know I’m lovedQuestions:1. What is the poem all about?2. what does being a Christian mean according to the author?3.What is your idea on the essence of being a Christian? Do you agree with the author' s perspective? Why or Why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Being a Christian does not equate to perfection. </p><p></p><p>2. It means that to be a "true" Christian, we have to accept our shortcomings, weaknesses and faults, because only God is perfect, and we should seek him for forgiveness of our sins and to give light to all our confusion. </p><p></p><p>3.My idea fits perfectly the meaning of this poem, so I agree with it. I believe that it's about being humble, accepting our weaknesses and welcoming God to our lives. Because through Him we will be saved, through Him we will be forgiven, and through him will we be given light to our confusions. </p><br />

 Camiguin are the sweetest.

                            15. I NEED HELP AGAIN PLSSSSMUDDY ROADA Zen Story Tanzan and Ekido were once traveling together down a muddy road. A heavy rain was still falling. Coming around a bend, they met a lovely girl in a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross the intersection. “Come on girl," said Tanzan at once. Lifting her in his arms , he carried her over the mud. Ekido did not speak again until that night when they reached a lodging temple. Then he no longer could restrain himself, "We monks don't go near females," he told Tanzan, “especially not young and lovely ones. It is dangerous. Why did you do that?" "I left the girl there," said Tanzan. "Are you still carryingher?”1. What is the message of the parable?2. What did Tanzan mean when he said to Ekido, “Are you still carrying her?”3. Why do you think Tanzan is bothered after helping a lovely girl?4. Do you think it is good to disobey one's rule just to help someone? Explain.5. Helping is a good manner, but what is stopping the monk to do this?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The message of the parable differs from how a person interpret the story, since this was a discussion in our class, for me this meant "It is alright to break a rule to help people if the intent in is pure". </p><p>2. The meaning of "Are you still carrying her?" is Ekido is still thinking about the girl, like the 'girl' got stuck in Ekido's mind and therefore a "load that Ekido is carrying". </p><p>3. Since Tanzan's intention of helping the girl is pure, he isn't bothered by it nor does he feel convicted even after knowing he broke the rule. </p><p>4.

                            17. Identify the thesis statement present in the following paragraphs below. If there is NO topic and concluding sentence, write NONE. 1.Driving under the alcohol influence isn’t a good practice for professional drivers. Nowadays, professional drivers who always find themselves partying till midnight will drive home drunk. Because they are very eager to go home, they will insist that they can drive. After some moments of driving, they will feel sleepy and eventually, they will be vulnerable to accidents and worse, even death. Therefore, it may be a cliché to say but still it is better not to drink and drive! 2.“It’s summertime! No doubt, people are dreaming of the ideal vacation: walking leisurely along the beach, or filling one’s lungs with fresh mountain air; waking up in the morning without being harassed by a list of things to do, or whiling away the hours without guilt or regret. For those with money to spend, the ideal vacation means endless shopping, touring, or partying. For people who are cash-strapped, vacation means staying at home, relishing the company of loved ones, watching TV, reading a book, or rearranging the furniture. For those bent on improving spiritual life, vacation means the time for retreats, recollections, or more intense personal prayers.” 3. Are you in love? Don’t have enough confidence to tell your feelings to someone special to you? Want to say sorry? Just want to request a song? Want to say thank you? Or you just want to say hello to your friends? Well, that is not a problem. Speaker’s bureau dedication booth is here. Let your message accompanied with your favorite song be heard dedicated to your special someone! 4.“I recall that even before I learned how to write my name, I was already into drawing. First, my mother would tell me that she doesn’t know how I learned to draw, every time I ask her. But she remembers that my joy then was to scribble anything that would smear itself on any surface. That meant pencils, chalks, pen, crayons, coloring pencils, even adobe stones and charcoals. Second, I remember too that every time I used these instruments on the wall, paper, floor, fence or pavement, I would always be stopped, scolded, spanked, reprimanded or at the very least, cautioned. But I did really love to see those smear tools do their dirtying job under the whim and every movement of my hand. That, I called drawing.” ​​</h2><br />

                            19. MUDDY ROADA Zen Story Tanzan and Ekido were once traveling together down a muddy road. A heavy rain was still falling. Coming around a bend, they met a lovely girl in a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross the intersection. “Come on girl," said Tanzan at once. Lifting her in his arms , he carried her over the mud. Ekido did not speak again until that night when they reached a lodging temple. Then he no longer could restrain himself, "We monks don't go near females," he told Tanzan, “especially not young and lovely ones. It is dangerous. Why did you do that?" "I left the girl there," said Tanzan. "Are you still carryingher?”1. What is the message of the parable?2. What did Tanzan mean when he said to Ekido, “Are you still carrying her?”3. Why do you think Tanzan is bothered after helping a lovely girl?4. Do you think it is good to disobey one's rule just to help someone? Explain.5. Helping is a good manner, but what is stopping the monk to do this?(I NEED IT NOW THE SUBMISSION IS TOMORROW)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The message of the parable differs from how a person interpret the story, since this was a discussion in our class, for me this meant "It is alright to break a rule to help people if the intent in is pure". </p><p>2. The meaning of "Are you still carrying her?" is Ekido is still thinking about the girl, like the 'girl' got stuck in Ekido's mind and therefore a "load that Ekido is carrying". </p><p>3. Since Tanzan's intention of helping the girl is pure, he isn't bothered by it nor does he feel convicted even after knowing he broke the rule. </p><p>4. In terms of religion rules, breaking a rule means you have sinned against the said religion and the God you serve, but the rule isn't and shouldn't be taken literally at all times, why do monks go near females for? For the reason that they might be tempted or that their resolve to be monk will waver. </p><p>5. Because the monk is not allowed to go near females especially the young and the lovely ones. And the monk might think that there will be punishment if they did that.</p><br />

Direction: Read each short passage very carefully. Infer the specific place they are referring to.
Passage 1:
 I hear a loud “thwack” as the ball leaves the ballpark and the crowd roars with cheers!
Can you infer where I am?

Passage 2:
 I see bubbles rising. I hear my own breathing. I love those colourful fish swimming above
me. I feel the seaweed swaying.
Can you infer where I am?
________________________________________________________________ Passage 3:
 This area is so silent. The people here are all looking for books, while some are sitting
on a wide table doing their assignments. I love this place so much. I could choose a book

_______________________________________________________________________
The term “inference” refers to an educated guess or conclusion that is formed because
of known facts or evidence plus prior knowledge and experience.
Making an inference basically involves what you know to make a guess about what you
don’t know yet. That is why, it is really important to read between the lines first. In literature, we
use inference to find an intended meaning and to explore what the author is trying to teach us.
A reader who make inferences are using a clue in a text along with their own experiences
which allows them to figure out what is not directly stated, making the text personal and
memorable.
Passage 5:
I can see a lot of computers in each corner. You can see people sitting with
headphones while some are still standing waiting for vacant seats. Some are silently
researching, while others are so noisy playing online games.

Study and underline the different modals mentioned in this song.
"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive

BALLAD OF A MOTHER'S HEART BY JOSE LA VILLA TIERRAThe night was dark,For the moon was young,And the Stars were asleep and rare,The clouds were thick,Yet Youth went out,To see his Maiden fair.Dear one,he pleaded as he knelt before her feet in tears.My love is true,Why you have kept me waiting all this years?The maiden looked at him.Unmoved it seemed,And whispered low.Persistent Youth,You have to prove by deeds,Your love is true."There's not a thingI would not do for you, Beloved" said he."Then, go." said she. "To your mother dear,And bring her heart to me.Without another word,Youth left and went to his mother dear.He opened her breast and took her heart!But he did not shed a tear.Then back to his Maiden fair,He run unmindful of the rain.But his feet slipped, And he fell down,And loud, he groaned with pain!Still in his hand he held the prize,That would win his Maiden's hands.But he thought of his mother dear,So kind,so sweet,so fond.And then,he heard a voice!Not from his lips,But all apart!"Get up" it said."Were you hurt,Child?"It was his mother's heartThink it through 1.

"Locked Away"
by R. City feat. Adam Levine
If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
Right about now.
If a judge for life me,
Would you stay by my side?
Or is ya gonna say good-bye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life,
Shorty, would it be alright?
Come and show me that you are down
(ah-ha)
Now tell me would you really ride for me?
(would you really ride for me?)
Baby, tell me would you die for me?
(tell me would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me?
(what's up?)
Would you be there to always hold me down?
Tell me would you really cry for me?
(would you really cry for me?)
Baby, don't lie to me.
(baby, don't lie to me)
If I didn't have anything,
(what's up?)
I wanna know would you stick around?

And we lost it all today,

Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

                            28. O Lord, my God, teach my heart where and how to seek You.Teach my heart where and how to find You.You are my God and my Lord and I've never seen You.You've made me and remade me and bestowed on me all the goodthings I haveAnd still I do not know You.I have not done that for which I was made.O Lord, my God, teach my heart where and how to seek You.Teach my heart where and how to find You,for I cannot see You unless You teach me,or find You unless You show Yourself to me.Let me seek You in my desire. Let me desire You in my seekingLet me find You by my loving You now.Let me love You when I find You.Teach me, Lord.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>In truth, I think the meaning of the song, is that whoever was singing this, wanted to seek and find God. They state in a few verses that he/she was made by God, and yet, they have never seen him. They ask of God to teach him/her how to find him, to seek him. They state that they cannot see him, unless he teaches them, or that they cannot find him unless he shows himself to them. They want to love God when they find him, and they want him to teach their hearts on how to find him.</strong></p><p><strong>The line that I found interesting was:</strong></p><p><strong>"</strong><strong>Teach my heart where to find You, for I cannot see You unless You teach me, or find You unless You show yourself to me."</strong></p><p><strong>I found it interesting because it shows that no matter how hard we try, only God can show himself. No amount of will and force can make God show himself to us. It is him we need to find, not the other way around. We are not the ones who will show ourselves to him, but rather, he would show himself to us.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
