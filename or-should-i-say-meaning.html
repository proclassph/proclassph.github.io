If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad (no no no)
If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad
You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)</a>

But sometimes a part of the bible make me question " is this true??" "is this right? or wrong?" and the most important is " did god say this? did god allow such thing??"  this is the time where i think some specific word came from a human/mortal and not from god or jesus, just to satisfy their own belief and needs not from faith and devotion. i dont doubt God, i doubt the humans and hands who wrote it. Well we can do say that the 'bible' MAYBE re written by tainted and malicious hands over thousands of years. MY REAL PROBLEM is, Am i sinful? for not believing the bible and even doubting it? is that a offense to God? If i believe in God, does that necessarily mean i should believe in every word of the Bible??.​</a>

                                            As a grade 12 students how will you promote
Answer:
For me, I've noticed that folkdance is no longer practiced, or should I say that some people have forgotten about it, but others have not. For me, the best method to maintain and strengthen our folkdance is to promote and perform it in many ways, such as group dance competitions in schools, whether local, national, or international, with the assistance of teachers, particularly in Mapeh. As a grade 12 student, I will utilize my voice to speak out about the value of folkdance and why it should not be overlooked. And to explain that each motion and movement in dancing has its own unique meaning that will astound you. I'll transport them back to the years when folkdance was popular.</a>

                            14. If i told i was perfect i'd be lying
If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad (no no no)
If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad
You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)</h2><br />

But sometimes a part of the bible make me question " is this true??" "is this right? or wrong?" and the most important is " did god say this? did god allow such thing??"  this is the time where i think some specific word came from a human/mortal and not from god or jesus, just to satisfy their own belief and needs not from faith and devotion. i dont doubt God, i doubt the humans and hands who wrote it. Well we can do say that the 'bible' MAYBE re written by tainted and malicious hands over thousands of years. MY REAL PROBLEM is, Am i sinful? for not believing the bible and even doubting it? is that a offense to God?

Bimpe: Are you saying I shouldn't marry       him?   Kemi: Why should I say that?b).Segun: i am the best footballer in my team.     Akin: isn't that obvious with the penalty kick you lost last night?c)." I saw her dash across the road, fear written all over her. I was about approaching her when i saw him at the balcony with a big stick. Oh!they are at it again!"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A) Inference:Linguistic Cues: In the first piece of discourse, Kemi's use of the phrase "true character" implies that the person she was in courtship with was not behaving in a way that was expected of him. In the second piece of discourse, Segun's use of the phrase "best footballer" and Akin's response can be interpreted as Segun making an overconfident claim that is contradicted by the results of his performance. In the third piece of discourse, the narrator's description of "fear written all over her" and the sight of the person with a "big stick" implies that the woman is in danger.Contextual Cues: The contextual cues for the first piece of discourse are the conversation between Kemi and Bimpe, which suggests that Bimpe is considering marriage and is asking Kemi for advice. The contextual cues for the second piece of discourse are the mention of a penalty kick and the results of Segun's performance, which suggests that Segun is boasting about his skills despite his failure in the penalty kick. The contextual cues for the third piece of discourse are the narrator's observation of the woman running in fear and the person with a big stick, which suggests that the woman is in an abusive relationship.<strong>a</strong>) Kemi is implying that Bimpe should not marry the person Kemi was in a relationship with because Kemi knows their true character. This is inferred from Kemi's statement about quitting the relationship because of the person's true character and Bimpe's response asking if Kemi is saying she shouldn't marry the person.<strong>b</strong>) Akin is implying that Segun is not the best footballer in the team because of the penalty kick he lost last night. This is inferred from Segun's statement about being the best footballer and Akin's response mentioning the penalty kick.<strong>c</strong>) The speaker is implying that the person they saw running across the road is in danger because the speaker saw fear on their face and someone else with a weapon on the balcony. This is inferred from the description of the person running across the road with fear and the mention of someone else with a weapon on the balcony.___________________________<p><strong>Have </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>great </strong><strong>day</strong><strong>!</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The speaker reflects on the past seven months and seven years of their life, and how they have come to realize the heavy weight of responsibility that comes with being an adult in a tough and sometimes mad world. They have learned that many of the things they were taught about love, success, and goals were just lies, and that they now have a hollow soul. Despite this, the speaker acknowledges that they now know the reality of being an adult, and that they must face it head on, even if they don't know where to go from here.</p><br />

Answer:
For me, I've noticed that folkdance is no longer practiced, or should I say that some people have forgotten about it, but others have not. For me, the best method to maintain and strengthen our folkdance is to promote and perform it in many ways, such as group dance competitions in schools, whether local, national, or international, with the assistance of teachers, particularly in Mapeh. As a grade 12 student, I will utilize my voice to speak out about the value of folkdance and why it should not be overlooked. And to explain that each motion and movement in dancing has its own unique meaning that will astound you. I'll transport them back to the years when folkdance was popular.</h2><br />
