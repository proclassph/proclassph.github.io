The Black Panther
The Marvel Cinematic Universe has dominated the film industry in the last decade.
Starting with the first widely successful film “Iron Man” starring Robert Downey, Jr., Marvel
Studios has since released more than 20 films, creating the biggest movie franchise to
date. After Iron Man, the MCU has brought dozens of comic book characters to life on the
big screen; some better than others. Among those characters adapted into a film, one
stands out whose film version is a vast improvement of the comic version. This is the Black
Panther. Black Panther’s film version, portrayed by Chadwick Boseman, is a much better
rendition than the comic book version because of better characterization, a more feminist
ideology, and a more significant social impact.
First, the film version of the Black Panther is a better character than the comic
book version. While their identity as T’Challa—the King of the fictional African
nation Wakanda—is consistent, film T’Challa is a more level-headed ruler, who rarely
lets his emotions cloud his better judgment. He also treats his subjects and tribe
chieftains with respect. Integrity dictates may of his actions, even against his foes. Comics
T’Challa, on the other hand, while generally a wise and strong-willed ruler, tends to be
arrogant and impetuous. He is also more condescending towards people he deems
inferior in stature. And he is more than willing to resort to nefarious means or under-handed
tactics to gain an edge against enemies.
Second, the social milieu of the film Black Panther’s Wakanda is very feminist in
ideology. His personal army of defenders, the Dora Milaje, are esteemed warriors
unmatched by anyone in the country, man or woman. The women, such as T’Challa’s
mother and his genius sister, are vital members of the country’s government. The roles
of women are portrayed as though it is natural for them to be at par with the men; in fact,
one would note no social distinction between the sexes. On the other hand, the Dora Milaje
in the comics is not just a personal army but also a harem for T’Challa, from whom he may
select a bride of his choosing. While they are still prominent, the women of Wakanda in the
comics are, in many ways, second-class citizens. Their lives and fates are all in T’Challa’s
hands.
Third, the film version of Black Panther had a more far-reaching effect on its fans.
Black Panther was the first African superhero to be portrayed in comics, which made
the character very significant at the time of release. However, the relatively limited reach
of comics, as well as the somewhat problematic nature of his character, made him more
polarizing among comics fans. On the other hand, thanks to the mainstream scope of the
MCU, the film version of Black Panther was able to reach a wider audience. In addition,
many African and African-American fans were better able to identify with or be inspired by
him. He was a powerful, heroic, virtuous man of color; and on top of that, he was a king.
Thus he became a symbol of greatness for the marginalized.
The MCU has breathed new life into both the comic book industry and the film
industry. Fans who have enjoyed the comics are treated to a spectacle beyond anything
they had once imagined. Fans who have been exposed to the characters through the
films find themselves seeking more material, the original comic books included.
Prominent among these is the King of Wakanda, the Black Panther, who through the films
has become an inspiration to those who once upon a time had no heroes representing
them on a grand stage.</a>

The Black Panther
The Marvel Cinematic Universe has dominated the film industry in the last decade.
Starting with the first widely successful film “Iron Man” starring Robert Downey, Jr., Marvel
Studios has since released more than 20 films, creating the biggest movie franchise to
date. After Iron Man, the MCU has brought dozens of comic book characters to life on the
big screen; some better than others. Among those characters adapted into a film, one
stands out whose film version is a vast improvement of the comic version. This is the Black
Panther. Black Panther’s film version, portrayed by Chadwick Boseman, is a much better
rendition than the comic book version because of better characterization, a more feminist
ideology, and a more significant social impact.
First, the film version of the Black Panther is a better character than the comic
book version. While their identity as T’Challa—the King of the fictional African
nation Wakanda—is consistent, film T’Challa is a more level-headed ruler, who rarely
lets his emotions cloud his better judgment. He also treats his subjects and tribe
chieftains with respect. Integrity dictates may of his actions, even against his foes. Comics
T’Challa, on the other hand, while generally a wise and strong-willed ruler, tends to be
arrogant and impetuous. He is also more condescending towards people he deems
inferior in stature. And he is more than willing to resort to nefarious means or under-handed
tactics to gain an edge against enemies.
Second, the social milieu of the film Black Panther’s Wakanda is very feminist in
ideology. His personal army of defenders, the Dora Milaje, are esteemed warriors
unmatched by anyone in the country, man or woman. The women, such as T’Challa’s
mother and his genius sister, are vital members of the country’s government. The roles
of women are portrayed as though it is natural for them to be at par with the men; in fact,
one would note no social distinction between the sexes. On the other hand, the Dora Milaje
in the comics is not just a personal army but also a harem for T’Challa, from whom he may
select a bride of his choosing. While they are still prominent, the women of Wakanda in the
comics are, in many ways, second-class citizens. Their lives and fates are all in T’Challa’s
hands.
Third, the film version of Black Panther had a more far-reaching effect on its fans.
Black Panther was the first African superhero to be portrayed in comics, which made
the character very significant at the time of release. However, the relatively limited reach
of comics, as well as the somewhat problematic nature of his character, made him more
polarizing among comics fans. On the other hand, thanks to the mainstream scope of the
MCU, the film version of Black Panther was able to reach a wider audience. In addition,
many African and African-American fans were better able to identify with or be inspired by
him. He was a powerful, heroic, virtuous man of color; and on top of that, he was a king.
Thus he became a symbol of greatness for the marginalized.
The MCU has breathed new life into both the comic book industry and the film
industry. Fans who have enjoyed the comics are treated to a spectacle beyond anything
they had once imagined. Fans who have been exposed to the characters through the
films find themselves seeking more material, the original comic books included.
Prominent among these is the King of Wakanda, the Black Panther, who through the films
has become an inspiration to those who once upon a time had no heroes representing
them on a grand stage.</h2><br />
