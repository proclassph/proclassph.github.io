                                            Power can corrupt an individual. How can a person avoid being corrupted by a power or abuse of power given to him/her?​
Power can be a double-edged sword, as it can both empower and corrupt an individual. While power can bring great success and recognition, it also has the potential to lead to abuse of power. To avoid being corrupted by power, it is important for individuals to remember that with great power comes great responsibility.
Individuals should strive to use their power responsibly and ethically. This includes avoiding the temptation of taking advantage of others or abusing their position for personal gain. It is also important for individuals to stay humble and recognize that they are not invincible or untouchable due to their position of power. Finally, individuals should practice self-reflection in order to identify any signs of corruption or abuse of power before they become too entrenched in their behavior.</a>

It helps in being a good conversationalist that you can speak intelligently on many subjects. It affects how we invest or save our money. Even our choices in clothing/fashion are determined by culture and society. Politics affects all, the need to keep up is important yet can be boring. It can be volatile as everyone has their own opinion and most feel entrenched in their beliefs. All three subjects are in many ways entwined and in one way or another form us into who we are.hope it helps :) wla lng bored aq​</a>

You will get 1pt.each for both challenge and strength/ weakness. Summary of “FAITH, LOVE, TIME AND DR. LAZARO” By: Gregorio Brillantes Lazaro is a pool of darkness surrounded by light. Indeed, light, its retreat and approach, its highs and ebbs, is a central motif throughout the story and one which must be watched closely. Light is associated with all the things Lazaro no longer believes in. One, it is associated with faith, Mrs. Lazaro had resumed her knitting; in the circle of yellow light, her head bowed, she seemed absorbed in some contemplative prayer... He hurried down the carving stairs, under the votive lamps of the Sacred Heart. Two, light is also associated with those he loves but is distant from, notably Ben, his son, In the glow of the dashboard lights, the boy's face relaxed, smiled. Third, light is finally also associated with life itself. Their final stop before heading to the hut where the death of the baby waits is a gas station, its fluorescent lights the only brightness on the plain before them, on the road that led farther into deeper darkness. This is the final outpost, bathed in light, before they enter death's realm and administer to a baby Lazaro knows he cannot save. (The descent towards darkness and death is further seen in their crossing of a river, to drown here in the depths of the night before they reach the hut - an allusion to the River Styx.) Once they reach Esteban's hut, darkness is well and truly entrenched; so much so that even light can only be described in relation to darkness, 'We're here doctor,' Esteban said, and they padded up a stretch of sand to a clump of trees; a dog started to bark, the shadows of a kerosene lamp wavered at a window. The preponderance of darkness, and the linking of existential themes to light (themes which Lazaro yearns for but can no longer believe in), illustrates that Lazaro is a damaged man; scarred irrevocably by his work (duty had taken the place of an exhausted compassion) and the loss of his first son (He closed his eyes, erasing the slashed wrists, part of the future dead in a boarding-house room... Sorrow lay in ambush among the years.). That Lazarus is damaged is aptly seen in the darkness surrounding him. He thought of light years, black space, and infinite distances; in the unmeasured universe, man's life flared briefly and was gone, traceless in the void. But can there be a resurrection? After all the character's name harkens to the biblical Lazarus who was literally raised out of darkness. There are encouraging signs as the short story progresses that Lazaro tentatively takes some steps towards the light, ie. he begins to believe again in faith, hope and love. The catalyst for this spark of belief is Ben, his last son, He could sense the boy groping for the tremendous answers... a woman bathed in light appeared before children, and mortal men spoke of eternal life... With unaccustomed tenderness he placed a hand on Ben's shoulder as they turned toward the cement-walled house. Lazaro comes close. But just as Ben tries to articulate all the light his father has lost, of faith and hope, the light becomes too strong and blind Lazarus. This is literally seen in the story for just as Lazarus again yearns to believe, A bus roared around a hill toward them, its lights blinding him. Lazaro falls back into darkness and is denied the light. Instead of faith, hope and love he is consigned back to his tomb of death and dirt. In the headlights the dust sifted down and when the air was clear again, Dr. Lazaro, swallowing a taste of earth, of darkness, maneuvered the car back onto the road, his arms numb and exhausted. There is no resurrection for this story's Lazarus. POINTS The darkness though does not make Lazaro an evil man. He is simply tired, a character who has seen too much and who, like Job, asks what did man do to deserve this lot. The sparrow does not fall without the Father's leave, he mused at the sky, but it falls just the same. But to what end are the sufferings of a child? And again like Job, Lazarus has the temerity to insist that is wrong and to ask the only question there is to ask; why?

Mental Health in The Time of COVID-19 and Social Distancing
By Ryanne Co
As someone who comes from a family of worriers, I will be the first to 
tell you: this new pandemic nothing to be taken lightly. There’s constant 
worry, and now, as we live through the first leg of enhanced community 
quarantine, I can imagine that the struggle with anxiety could get worse. Dr. 
Ronald del Castillo, a doctor of psychology (PsyD) and a master of public 
health (MPH) from the University of the Philippines Manila, concurs.
He says: “For those of us who are already experiencing mental health 
problems before the outbreak, such as depression, bipolar or other mental 
disorders, the quarantine can aggravate an already tough situation. Now, 
muddle these with other circumstances, many of which are entrenched for us 
here in the country, such as poverty, unemployment or underemployment, 
isolation, poor transportation, limited health care access, or disingenuous 
politicians, then the psychological impact of the quarantine is all the more 
difficult.”
And true enough, stories have been surfacing online of people worried 
about having to be quarantined alone or with toxic family members or 
roommates. It’s difficult when the flow of our everyday lives is disrupted by 
something as serious as a pandemic. With this, Tatler Philippines has 
compiled a list of tips on how we can get through this quarantine together. 
It’s all about taking a step back, slowing things down, and getting used to a 
new routine that, like everything else, is temporary.</a>

To avoid being corrupted by power, it is important for individuals to remember that with great power comes great responsibility.
Individuals should strive to use their power responsibly and ethically. This includes avoiding the temptation of taking advantage of others or abusing their position for personal gain. It is also important for individuals to stay humble and recognize that they are not invincible or untouchable due to their position of power. Finally, individuals should practice self-reflection in order to identify any signs of corruption or abuse of power before they become too entrenched in their behavior.</h2><br />

It is also helpful to have systems of accountability in place, such as regular performance evaluations or external oversight.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Foster a culture of transparency and trust</strong>: Organizations should foster a culture of transparency and trust, where individuals are encouraged to speak up about ethical concerns without fear of retaliation. This can help prevent abuse of power and hold individuals accountable for their actions.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Continuously learn and improve</strong>: Individuals should continuously learn and improve their skills and knowledge, particularly in areas related to their position of power. This can help them make more informed and ethical decisions, and also prevent complacency or overconfidence.</p><p></p><p>5. <strong>Practice empathy and humility</strong>: Individuals should practice empathy and humility, which can help them better understand the needs and perspectives of others, and avoid the temptation to use their power for personal gain. It is also important to recognize that mistakes can happen, and to take responsibility and make amends when necessary.</p><p></p><br />

You will get 1pt.each for both challenge and strength/ weakness. Summary of “FAITH, LOVE, TIME AND DR. LAZARO” By: Gregorio Brillantes Lazaro is a pool of darkness surrounded by light. Indeed, light, its retreat and approach, its highs and ebbs, is a central motif throughout the story and one which must be watched closely. Light is associated with all the things Lazaro no longer believes in. One, it is associated with faith, Mrs. Lazaro had resumed her knitting; in the circle of yellow light, her head bowed, she seemed absorbed in some contemplative prayer... He hurried down the carving stairs, under the votive lamps of the Sacred Heart. Two, light is also associated with those he loves but is distant from, notably Ben, his son, In the glow of the dashboard lights, the boy's face relaxed, smiled. Third, light is finally also associated with life itself. Their final stop before heading to the hut where the death of the baby waits is a gas station, its fluorescent lights the only brightness on the plain before them, on the road that led farther into deeper darkness. This is the final outpost, bathed in light, before they enter death's realm and administer to a baby Lazaro knows he cannot save. (The descent towards darkness and death is further seen in their crossing of a river, to drown here in the depths of the night before they reach the hut - an allusion to the River Styx.) Once they reach Esteban's hut, darkness is well and truly entrenched; so much so that even light can only be described in relation to darkness, 'We're here doctor,' Esteban said, and they padded up a stretch of sand to a clump of trees; a dog started to bark, the shadows of a kerosene lamp wavered at a window. The preponderance of darkness, and the linking of existential themes to light (themes which Lazaro yearns for but can no longer believe in), illustrates that Lazaro is a damaged man; scarred irrevocably by his work (duty had taken the place of an exhausted compassion) and the loss of his first son (He closed his eyes, erasing the slashed wrists, part of the future dead in a boarding-house room... Sorrow lay in ambush among the years.). That Lazarus is damaged is aptly seen in the darkness surrounding him. He thought of light years, black space, and infinite distances; in the unmeasured universe, man's life flared briefly and was gone, traceless in the void. But can there be a resurrection? After all the character's name harkens to the biblical Lazarus who was literally raised out of darkness. There are encouraging signs as the short story progresses that Lazaro tentatively takes some steps towards the light, ie. he begins to believe again in faith, hope and love. The catalyst for this spark of belief is Ben, his last son, He could sense the boy groping for the tremendous answers... a woman bathed in light appeared before children, and mortal men spoke of eternal life... With unaccustomed tenderness he placed a hand on Ben's shoulder as they turned toward the cement-walled house. Lazaro comes close. But just as Ben tries to articulate all the light his father has lost, of faith and hope, the light becomes too strong and blind Lazarus. This is literally seen in the story for just as Lazarus again yearns to believe, A bus roared around a hill toward them, its lights blinding him. Lazaro falls back into darkness and is denied the light. Instead of faith, hope and love he is consigned back to his tomb of death and dirt. In the headlights the dust sifted down and when the air was clear again, Dr. Lazaro, swallowing a taste of earth, of darkness, maneuvered the car back onto the road, his arms numb and exhausted. There is no resurrection for this story's Lazarus. POINTS The darkness though does not make Lazaro an evil man. He is simply tired, a character who has seen too much and who, like Job, asks what did man do to deserve this lot. The sparrow does not fall without the Father's leave, he mused at the sky, but it falls just the same. But to what end are the sufferings of a child? And again like Job, Lazarus has the temerity to insist that is wrong and to ask the only question there is to ask; why?

2. As a Filipino of the contemporary world, what do you think is the most viable way to minimize such structures that seem to pose large problems surrounding development</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2. The Philippines is an Asian nation that had been colonized twice. It was a Spanish colony and later became an American colony. So it had Spanish and Hispanic culture and has a national identity in Asia. So it was exposed to a wider area of a modern world culturally. In the modern world system, it is a matter of political, economic, and military participation. Its militray resources are less and it is difficult for Philippines to intervene in regions that are outside Philipines.It won't act against another country politically or militarily but if Philippines is attacked,it will react. Phillipines non interfering friendliness will attract many nations towards Phillipines. This shows Philippines success in its participation with the rest of the modern world.</p><p></p><p>As Filipino we suggest a truly chief change in the manner to manage improvement exploration and system making - such an adjustment in standpoint if you like guided by going with three norms:</p><p></p><p>1. Affirmation of good assortment as an overall attribute of the overall organization ii. Affirmation of unequivocally openly setting as the reason for the trip for development investigation and methodology</p><p></p><p>making</p><p></p><p>iii. Task of close-by data, effort, and action as the unmistakable advantages being developed. A setting express system doesn't plan to supersede neo radicalism with another perspective that guarantees comprehensive substantiality. It suggests that money related cycles in any general public are embedded in a specific chronicled, socio-social and institutional setting that conditions the 'monetary' lead of social administrators and the working of business areas and the state. Thusly the fitting evening out of market and state includes setting and experimentation.</p><p></p><br />

Mental Health in The Time of COVID-19 and Social Distancing
By Ryanne Co
As someone who comes from a family of worriers, I will be the first to 
tell you: this new pandemic nothing to be taken lightly. There’s constant 
worry, and now, as we live through the first leg of enhanced community 
quarantine, I can imagine that the struggle with anxiety could get worse. Dr. 
Ronald del Castillo, a doctor of psychology (PsyD) and a master of public 
health (MPH) from the University of the Philippines Manila, concurs.
He says: “For those of us who are already experiencing mental health 
problems before the outbreak, such as depression, bipolar or other mental 
disorders, the quarantine can aggravate an already tough situation. Now, 
muddle these with other circumstances, many of which are entrenched for us 
here in the country, such as poverty, unemployment or underemployment, 
isolation, poor transportation, limited health care access, or disingenuous 
politicians, then the psychological impact of the quarantine is all the more 
difficult.”
And true enough, stories have been surfacing online of people worried 
about having to be quarantined alone or with toxic family members or 
roommates. It’s difficult when the flow of our everyday lives is disrupted by 
something as serious as a pandemic. With this, Tatler Philippines has 
compiled a list of tips on how we can get through this quarantine together. 
It’s all about taking a step back, slowing things down, and getting used to a 
new routine that, like everything else, is temporary.</h2><br />
