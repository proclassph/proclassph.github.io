                                            You know, sometimes you can be blinded by your extreme emotions. I definitely was looking for answers, during that time when I wrote that song, and yeah, I was depressed and sad, and there were thoughts, but there were never actions, thankfully. But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like you’re the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you’re fine when you’re not really fine, but you just can’t get into it, because they would never understand. Well, then comes along a song that speaks to you, that makes you feel like ‘Gosh, I can get through this if she can get through this, I can get through this.'"ccc</a>

Liza: Why didn't you? Did you find it difficult too?
Dianne: No, it wasn't. I just had to take time for the textual evidences she required.

                        <p></p><p></p><p>it's good to use gadgets. But we must limit our use of it. The gadget has a good effect on us especially on children. For example, doing assignments, researching about the lesson, and it can also be used in the online class. But it also has side effects. Children should be monitored or restricted in playing with gadgets so that they do not become addicted and so that their studies are not neglected.</p><br />

He wanted to know which of the three princes would be the ideal successor. So he asked his sons. If you were to be changed into a bird, what kind of bird would ypu like to be? "First Prince, "I would like to be hawk ,brave and strong  a bird of war" Second prince "I would like to be an eagle, king of the birds and feared by all birds" Youngest Prince " would like to be a starling--- a plain and common bird but kind and good. It doesnot make others tremble with fear when they see it".       He is the ideal heir to the throne , a ruler that would know hot to be kind and just to the people, a sovereign who will inspire love among his subjects and not fear.
