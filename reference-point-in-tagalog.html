Although we cansee various pictures of Rhinoceros Beetle online,nothing can compare to seeing one up close andpersonalFrom experience, I can tell you that if one gets on your clothing, it'sreally impossible to get it off easily. The variety found in the Philippines isthe Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle. They may seem formidable and vicious, butappearance can be deceiving.They have sharp claws and those claws can only hurt you if you getpinched by them. Other than that, they are practically harmless. Theyalso have horns and there is a difference in length depending on whetherit's a male or female.From what I understand, it's the strongest insect in the world. I'mnot willing to test the assertion.1. What are the names of the two types of beetles which are found inthe Philippines?2. What variety of beetles do those two types come from?3. How did thedid the author describe the claws of “uwang""and"salagubang"?4. Do you think you will be hurt once you see an "uwang" or"salagubang"5.
