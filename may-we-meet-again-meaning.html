Cause and Effect 
Description
Problem and Solution
Sequence/Order
Compare and Contrast
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too.

His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</a>

But we are expecting the 300,000 somethingthat Secretary Bello has communicated to us and that would be also a problem again. Butthis time, we should know what to do.

Compare and Contrast
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</h2><br />
