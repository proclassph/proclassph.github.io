However, this trend has different meaning in Malaysia and Paraguay disapprove of giving gifts because they may consider it to be bribe. In Malaysia, you can't give a gift if you don't have a personal relationship with that person. Yet, in some countries like Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines, exchanging gifts is related to tradition. It is important for them to give gifts to each other. When someone decides to show his/her respect or love for someone with a present, he/she has to consider where this person comes from.pa answer ngayon pls i need po​</a>

I see the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness, I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too, I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better that this cruelty too will end, that peace and tranquility will return once more. In the meantime, I must hold on to my ideals. Perhaps the day will come when I’ll be able to realize them. 1.What is the atmosphere of the text? 2. What is the tone of the writer? 3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The atmosphere of the text is one of despair and hopelessness, as the writer describes the world as being transformed into a wilderness and approaching destruction.</p><p>The tone of the writer is one of melancholy and introspection, as they reflect on the suffering of millions and hold on to their ideals despite the seeming impossibility of achieving them.</p><p>The writer uses figurative language to convey their emotions and views about the world. For example, the approaching thunder is a metaphor for the impending destruction that the writer sees on the horizon. The transformation of the world into a wilderness is also a metaphor for the destruction of nature and the loss of human values. Finally, the writer's feeling that everything will change for the better is a form of hope, represented through the figurative language of looking up at the sky.</p><p>The theme of the text is one of hope and perseverance in the face of overwhelming despair. The writer acknowledges the suffering and chaos of the world, but refuses to give up on their ideals and beliefs in a better future. The text highlights the power of hope and the importance of holding onto one's values, even in the darkest of times.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) The atmosphere of the text is one of despair and hope. The writer acknowledges the chaos and suffering in the world but also holds onto hope for a better future.</p><p>2.) The tone of the writer is reflective and contemplative. The writer is thoughtful and introspective as they consider the state of the world and their own ideals.</p><p>3.) The writer uses figurative language such as "the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness" and "the approaching thunder" to convey the sense of impending doom and destruction. These metaphors suggest that the writer sees the world as a dangerous and inhospitable place. The phrase "hold on to my ideals" is also figurative language that suggests the writer is grasping onto something intangible in the face of difficult circumstances.</p><p>4.) The theme of the text is the tension between despair and hope in the face of adversity. The writer acknowledges the suffering and chaos in the world but refuses to give up on their ideals and hope for a better future. The text also explores the idea of holding onto something intangible, such as ideals or hope, in the face of difficult circumstances.</p><p></p><p>I hope this helps you!
