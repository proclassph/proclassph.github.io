                                            Competition and Coperation Explanations of the interrelation between competition and cooperation have evolved over the time. Early research into competition and cooperation defined each of them in terms of the distribution of rewards related to each. Competition was defined as a situation in which rewards are distributed unequally on the basis of performance, cooperation on the other hand, was defined as a situation in which rewards are distributed equally on the basis of mutual interactive behaviour among individuals. By this definition, a competitive situation requires at least on competitor to fail for each competitor that wins, while a cooperative situation offers a reward only if all members of the group receive it. Researchers have found definitions of competition and cooperation based upon rewards inadequate primarily because definitions of these two concepts based upon rewards depict them as opposite. In current understanding, competition is not viewed as opposite of cooperation, instead, cooperation is viewed as integral component of competition. Cooperation is necessary among team members, perhaps in a sporting event or in a political race, in order to win the competition, it is equally important to understand that cooperation is of great importance between teams in that same sporting event or ground rules of the game or election in order to compete. Interestingly, the word competition is derived from a Latin verb which means "to seek together." An understanding of the derivation of the word competition supports the understanding that cooperation, rather than evoking a characteristic at the opposite extreme of human nature from competition, is in reality a necessary factor in competition.QUESTIONS 1.

                                            In the given situation both Analene and Jessica like singing and reading. If set X represents Analene's liking and set Y represents Jessica's liking, then singing and reading represents the intersection of sets X and Y which is denoted by X Π Υ. The intersection of sets X and Y, denoted by X NY, is a set containing the members or elements that can be found in both sets X and Y. The symbol n means "Intersection". Therefore, the intersection of X and Y can be written in the form XnY {reading, singing) The intersection of sets X and Y can be represented using a Venn diagram. The diagram on the right shows that singing and reading belongs to both sets X and Y. 8 Solution: Example 1. Find the intersection of sets A and B.

                                            without political influence, etc. These gray areas require considerable ethical scrutiny which incited the Church toprovide some basic guidelines. The Compendium summarizes the intent of these guidelines as follows:Pius XI long ago recognized that customers, employees, and community have a claim on business enterprisesbecause of their contributions to it. Every business executive has the responsibility of assessing these claims andresponding to them within the scope of establishing efficient means of production and competitive profits for itsinvestors. It should be mentioned, that this way of doing business has been found to be a far better model forguaranteeing the long term liability of a business-and therefore for guaranteeing long-term shareholder wealth.Why? Because customers who believe they have been treated with fairly will return to purchase more. Employeeswho believe they have been treated fairly will not only have high morale and loyalty, but also contribute creativity,personal initiative, and higher effort to company objectives. Community members who believe that they have beentreated fairly attempt to accommodate those businesses and provide incentives for them to grow, etc. Thusstakeholder analysis is not only good ethics, it is also good business.35​</a>

Are you familiar of the word 'Quarantanim"? It is not found in the dictionary but itis seeming to be viral all over the internet. Quarantanim is from the words quarantine and tanin, meaning planting during quarantine. Today, most families do 'quarantanim' at home. This is being of ways to become productive during the Enhanced Community Quarantine. Aling Joana and her husband do 'quarantanim'. Instead of waste their time during the lockdown they planted vegetables in their backyard. Their children namely John and Johna help them in planting and watering their plants. They put organic fertilizer to assurethat their plants grow healthy. After two months of lockdown, their vegetable plants grew well and bore fruits. They shared their harvests to their neighbors, relatives and friends. They sold some of it. With this, they earned money and had free vegetables fortheir meals. This is a manifestation of positivity during this time of pandemic; members of the family help one another to survive. How about you and your family? Do you also do quarantanim?

                                            What's NewRead the article below and find out what this is all about.What makes a good family? It is the family that sustains its members, supports andnourishes cach other. A strong family unit has to create a good family values, positiveand supportive place for all members to thrive. They are able to utilize resources andlive together in a fairly healthy manner.The adults in a strong family set the tone. They are the role models that lead byexample. They reach out to trends and community and teach their children theimportance of doing the same. They work together to solve problems, and they passtheir skills on to the next generation. Some important elements of a strong family arecohesion, flexibility and communication.Cohesion- In families, cohesion would be defined as the feeling of being loved, ofand being murtured by it. Although closeness is good in afamily unit, there must be a halance between being together and being separated. Aperson must be able to develop their individuality, while being supported by hisfamily. A few things that bring a family together are the commitment of other familymembers and the spending time together.Flexibility- Flexibility in a family would mean resilience with each member, elasticin decision makings and workability with each other. We could compare a successfulfamily to a democracy. There are leaders, but the whole group is involved in thedecision-making process. Although the leaders are in charge all members develop theability to cope with stress, and at times they lead. While the family works to avoidstressful situations, they work together to solve problems, without blaming, criticizingand finding each other's fault. Families that tend to have a strong spiritual base seemto have a sense of well-being that facilitates this working together in times of stress.Communication- A lack of communication can rip a family apart and destroy them.Things that facilitate communication are closeness, flexibility, time spent togetherand spirituality. Members of the family must have the freedom to express themselvesfreely. Another very important factor is the relationship between the "head" couple.In a family that is parented by a happily married couple, people are able to expressthemselves more freely. A happy marriage seems to set the tone in the house. It spillsover from the family to the community. A healthy family will reach out to help others.They do not tend to isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Families must beable to teach their children how to make good decisions. What the children learninside the house will to be carried by them. A healthy, happy family bencfits our wholesociety, with a healthy and strong families, there will be less crime, less divorce andless emotional problems.LET'SPROCESS THISAnswer the following questions.1.

Create an appropriategraphic organizer of your choice that highlights the author's idea about competitionand cooperationCompetition and Cooperation(1) Explanations of the interrelation between competition and cooperation haveevolved over the time. Early research into competition and cooperation defined eachof them in terms of the distribution of rewards related to each. Competition was detinedas a situation in which rewards are distributed unequally on the basis of performance,cooperation on the other hand, was defined as a situation in which rewards aredistributed equally on the basis of mutual interactive behavior among individuals. Bythis definition, a competitive situation requires at least on competitor to fail for eachcompetitor that wins, while a cooperative situation offers a reward only if all membersof the group receive it(2) Researchers have found definitions of competition and cooperation based uponrewards inadequate primarily because definitions of these two concepts based uponrewards depict them as opposite. In current understanding, competition is not viewedas opposite of cooperation, instead, cooperation is viewed as integral component ofcompetition Cooperation is necessary among team members, perhaps in a sportingevent or in a political race, in order to win the competition, it is equally important tounderstand that cooperation is of great importance between teams in that samesporting event or ground rules of the15 game or election in order to compete.(3) Interestingly, the word competition is derived from a Latin verb which means "toseek together." An understanding of the derivation of the word competition supportsthe understanding that cooperation, rather than evoking a characteristic at the oppositeextreme of human nature from competition, is in reality a necessary factor incompetition​</a>

                            11. Competition and Coperation Explanations of the interrelation between competition and cooperation have evolved over the time. Early research into competition and cooperation defined each of them in terms of the distribution of rewards related to each. Competition was defined as a situation in which rewards are distributed unequally on the basis of performance, cooperation on the other hand, was defined as a situation in which rewards are distributed equally on the basis of mutual interactive behaviour among individuals. By this definition, a competitive situation requires at least on competitor to fail for each competitor that wins, while a cooperative situation offers a reward only if all members of the group receive it. Researchers have found definitions of competition and cooperation based upon rewards inadequate primarily because definitions of these two concepts based upon rewards depict them as opposite. In current understanding, competition is not viewed as opposite of cooperation, instead, cooperation is viewed as integral component of competition. Cooperation is necessary among team members, perhaps in a sporting event or in a political race, in order to win the competition, it is equally important to understand that cooperation is of great importance between teams in that same sporting event or ground rules of the game or election in order to compete. Interestingly, the word competition is derived from a Latin verb which means "to seek together." An understanding of the derivation of the word competition supports the understanding that cooperation, rather than evoking a characteristic at the opposite extreme of human nature from competition, is in reality a necessary factor in competition.QUESTIONS 1.

                            15. In the given situation both Analene and Jessica like singing and reading. If set X represents Analene's liking and set Y represents Jessica's liking, then singing and reading represents the intersection of sets X and Y which is denoted by X Π Υ. The intersection of sets X and Y, denoted by X NY, is a set containing the members or elements that can be found in both sets X and Y. The symbol n means "Intersection". Therefore, the intersection of X and Y can be written in the form XnY {reading, singing) The intersection of sets X and Y can be represented using a Venn diagram. The diagram on the right shows that singing and reading belongs to both sets X and Y. 8 Solution: Example 1. Find the intersection of sets A and B. A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} therefore, Solution: City of Good Character DISCIPLINE GOOD TASTE EXCELLENCE . (An B) = {2, 4, 6} Example 2. Find the intersection of C and D. C = {m, a, t, h} dancing X 2, 4, and 6 are both in sets A and B If sets X and Y have no common member or element, then X Y = { }, we can say that X and Y are disjoint sets. Sets X and Y are said to be disjoint if and only if no elements of Set X are in Set Y. There are no common elements found in set C and D therefore, (CND) = {} X B=(2, 4, 6, 8, 10} D = {e, n, g} m C singing reading 1 5 at h 3 b A 2 4 Y 6 watching Y a B 8 g 10 D C In the previously given situation, If Analene and Jessica combine their list of hobbies, what do they have in all? If Analene is represented by set X = {dancing, singing, reading) and Jessica is represented by set Y = {watching, singing, reading), by combining their list of hobbies we may form a union of hobbies that belongs either to Analene or lessica or in both​</h2><br />

                            16. without political influence, etc. These gray areas require considerable ethical scrutiny which incited the Church toprovide some basic guidelines. The Compendium summarizes the intent of these guidelines as follows:Pius XI long ago recognized that customers, employees, and community have a claim on business enterprisesbecause of their contributions to it. Every business executive has the responsibility of assessing these claims andresponding to them within the scope of establishing efficient means of production and competitive profits for itsinvestors. It should be mentioned, that this way of doing business has been found to be a far better model forguaranteeing the long term liability of a business-and therefore for guaranteeing long-term shareholder wealth.Why? Because customers who believe they have been treated with fairly will return to purchase more. Employeeswho believe they have been treated fairly will not only have high morale and loyalty, but also contribute creativity,personal initiative, and higher effort to company objectives. Community members who believe that they have beentreated fairly attempt to accommodate those businesses and provide incentives for them to grow, etc. Thusstakeholder analysis is not only good ethics, it is also good business.35​</h2><br />

They put organic fertilizer to assurethat their plants grow healthy. After two months of lockdown, their vegetable plants grew well and bore fruits. They shared their harvests to their neighbors, relatives and friends. They sold some of it. With this, they earned money and had free vegetables fortheir meals.

Early research into competition and cooperation defined each of them in terms of the distribution of rewards related to each. Competition was defined as a situation in which rewards are distributed unequally on the basis of performance, cooperation on the other hand, was defined as a situation in which rewards are distributed equally on the basis of mutual interactive behaviour among individuals. By this definition, a competitive situation requires at least on competitor to fail for each competitor that wins, while a cooperative situation offers a reward only if all members of the group receive i. (2) Researchers have found definitions of competition and cooperation based upon rewards inadequate primarily because definitions of these two concepts based upon rewards depict them as opposite. In current understanding, competition is not viewed as opposite of cooperation, instead, cooperation is viewed as integral component of competition. Cooperation is necessary among team members, perhaps in a sporting event or in a political race, in order to win the competition, it is equally important to understand that cooperation is of great importance between teams in that same sporting event or ground rules of the game or election in order to compete. (3) Interestingly, the word competition is derived from a Latin verb which means to seek together." An understanding of the derivation of the word competition supports the understanding that cooperation, rather than evoking a characteristic at the opposite extreme of human nature from competition, is in reality a necessary factor in competition 1.

                            21. What's NewRead the article below and find out what this is all about.What makes a good family? It is the family that sustains its members, supports andnourishes cach other. A strong family unit has to create a good family values, positiveand supportive place for all members to thrive. They are able to utilize resources andlive together in a fairly healthy manner.The adults in a strong family set the tone. They are the role models that lead byexample. They reach out to trends and community and teach their children theimportance of doing the same. They work together to solve problems, and they passtheir skills on to the next generation. Some important elements of a strong family arecohesion, flexibility and communication.Cohesion- In families, cohesion would be defined as the feeling of being loved, ofand being murtured by it. Although closeness is good in afamily unit, there must be a halance between being together and being separated. Aperson must be able to develop their individuality, while being supported by hisfamily. A few things that bring a family together are the commitment of other familymembers and the spending time together.Flexibility- Flexibility in a family would mean resilience with each member, elasticin decision makings and workability with each other. We could compare a successfulfamily to a democracy. There are leaders, but the whole group is involved in thedecision-making process. Although the leaders are in charge all members develop theability to cope with stress, and at times they lead. While the family works to avoidstressful situations, they work together to solve problems, without blaming, criticizingand finding each other's fault. Families that tend to have a strong spiritual base seemto have a sense of well-being that facilitates this working together in times of stress.Communication- A lack of communication can rip a family apart and destroy them.Things that facilitate communication are closeness, flexibility, time spent togetherand spirituality. Members of the family must have the freedom to express themselvesfreely. Another very important factor is the relationship between the "head" couple.In a family that is parented by a happily married couple, people are able to expressthemselves more freely. A happy marriage seems to set the tone in the house. It spillsover from the family to the community. A healthy family will reach out to help others.They do not tend to isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Families must beable to teach their children how to make good decisions. What the children learninside the house will to be carried by them. A healthy, happy family bencfits our wholesociety, with a healthy and strong families, there will be less crime, less divorce andless emotional problems.LET'SPROCESS THISAnswer the following questions.1.

                            30. Jane has just begun her new job as on the sales force of a very competitive company. In a sample of 16 sales calls it was found that she closed the contract for an average value of 108 dollars with a standard deviation of 12 dollars. Test at 5% significance that the population mean is at least 100 dollars against the alternative that it is less than 100 dollars. Company policy requires that new members of the sales force must exceed an average of $100 per contract during the trial employment period. Can we conclude that Jane has met this requirement at the significance level of 95%?</h2><br />
