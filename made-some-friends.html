Friday
Dear Diary,
 I am feeling very excited tonight. We will be going on a field trip with my classmates and teachers. My things to bring are ready. I have packed some food items. My mother has made my favorite chicken sandwich and pork adobo. My friends will also bring some food and we shall all share and eat together. I feel I cannot go to sleep tonight.

PLEASE ANSWER THIS CORRECTLY OR REPORT BECAUSE I NEED THIS TO BE A REALLY GOOD ANSWER</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It's normal to make mistake sometimes but you must not cross the line because that would really make your parents disappointed, also they are the one who raised us since we were born. They gave you responsibilities because they have a trust in you, ask for forgiveness and your parents will be able to forgive you more easily if they feel heard and understood. Shutting up and listening can stop arguments and reduce emotional intensity. Staring blankly at your parents as they speak will likely upset them.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Based on Research</strong></p><br />

Dear Diary,
 I am feeling very excited tonight. We will be going on a field trip with my classmates and teachers. My things to bring are ready. I have packed some food items. My mother has made my favorite chicken sandwich and pork adobo. My friends will also bring some food and we shall all share and eat together. I feel I cannot go to sleep tonight.
