                                            Directions: Read and analyze very carefully this sample position paper. Then, accomplish the table by doing what are asked. "DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? "Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016, they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of people with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invested in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot. of people to think twice before taking their first puff.Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age.To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there.As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their dangerous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day become more obvious to them too.INTRODUCTION•What is the issue about?•Background • Relevance•Thesis statementBODY•Argument•Counter-argument •Evidences presentedCONCLUSION •Restated position •Course of action presented​</a>

                                            DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

2. Nutritionists say that our diet should always include fruits. Most fruits are rich in vitamins and minerals. Citrus fruits like oranges and pomelo give Vitamin C but the guava fruit is a very rich source of Vitamin C. Yellow fruits such as mango, tiesa, papaya, and lacatan are rich in Vitamin A which keeps our eyes bright and healthy. Durian and marang, which grow well in Mindanao, are nutritious and are considered aphrodisiacs. WHAT IS THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THIS PARAGRAPH?

3. Fruit trees are proving to be good investment and with agri-business now getting more attention from both the government and private sector, the fruit industry's future looks bright. Among agriculture exports, fruit products have the most promising growth prospects. One indication that investors are turning to fruit-tree growing as money-making venture is the brisk sale of fruit tree seedlings. Report from a new firm specializing in grafted fruit trees shows that an average of 50,000 seedlings are sold per month. WHAT IS THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THIS PARAGRAPH?

4. Of all the local grown fruit trees, mangoes are the most profitable. Based on the 1998 data from the Bureau of Agriculture, mangoes harvested from a one-hectare lot were valued at P105, 000. Next on the list are lanzones, which yielded fruit worth P75, 000 per hectare in 1998, and citrus jackfruit which grossed P50, 000 per hectare in the same year. Other fruit trees worth investing in are chico, atis, caimito, pili, avocado, guyabano, and cashew. As these trees grow older, they tend to bear more fruit, and this yield means more profit.

THE ISSUE:But in some way or another, the pandemic which caused sudden failures and disappointments in life and labor transforms the ordinary into an extraordinary renewal of what was lost. Strong family ties and relationship was built – evenTiktok videos are well-liked and performed by elders together with their children; the environment is smoothly recovering from pollution and breakage – pollution temporarily halted for a month of locked down; most people cultivated the land – even pots and plastic containers were used to plant for future consumption. Discipline was instilled – most learned how to follow rules and how to wait and give turns to others. Diligence in earning a living and finding means were made satisfied through online selling. Health was even worth the price! - we are even encouraged to wash hands and eat vegetables always. Education had never stopped upon finding means – different learning modalities are offered to us. Concerns and love to one another are fostered – giving and sharing were evident; and most especially our faith and trust in God are restored.We are all taught to adjust ourselves in this New Normal life and everyone is included. And that’s for our good - to keep us safe from harm and to stay alive. As I raised my head, I know that this is just a test of time. A period of everyone’s life to be resilient, cared, hopeful, and prayerful. I believe that this pandemic will end the soonest and everything will just be a part of the history of human life.​</a>

There must be some mistake.I wish there was a clock whose hands i could rewind.We might have saved these creatures if we'd just had more time.Time to make people see how we are damaging our Earth,Time to realize what it all was tryly worth.But the animals are dissappearing at an alarming rate.If we don't finally band together,it may really be too late.SAQ-1: Let us try to check your reading comprehension skills by answering the following questions about the poem:1)What are the things that the author wishes to see again?2)Why have they disappeared?3)What can you do to keep the animals' homes like land and waters safe?4)How does the author present the information to make us realize?​</a>

                                            But in some way or another, the pandemic which caused sudden fallures anddisappointments in life and labor transforms the ordinary into an extraordinary renewalof what was lost. Strong family ties and relationshipwas built - even Tiktok videos arewell-liked and performed by elders together with their children; the environment issmoothly recovering from pollution and breakage - pollution temporarily halted for amonth of locked down; most people cultivated the landeven pots and plasticcontainers were used to plant for future consumption. Discipline was instilled - mostlearned how to follow rules an seed how to wait and giveturns to others. Diligence inearning a living and finding means were made satisfied through online selling. HealthWas even worth thepricel - we are even encouraged to wash hands and eat vegetablesalways.Education had never stopped upon finding means - different learningmodalities are offered to us. Concerns and love to one another are fostered - givingand sharing were evident; andmost especially our faith and trust in God are restored.We are all taught to adjust ourselves in this New Normal life and everyone isincluded. And that's for our good to keep us safe fromharm and to stay alive.As I raised my head, I know that this is just a testof time. A period of everyone's life to be resilient, cared,hopeful, and prayerful. I believe that this pandemic willend the soonest and everything will just be a part of thehistory of human life.​what are the possible cause and effect in this story and possible solution</a>

                                            We respect people not because it is the right thing to do or because you need to do it, rather we co-exist with people and we recognize our similarities and differences. We accept them for who they are and we don't force to change them just to be like us. It's the same thing that they cannot do such to us. The following are just some ways to demonstrate our respect for others: 1. Respect yourself first. You cannot give what you don't have. You cannot control how others would see you but you can shape the way you see yourself. If you think that you deserve to be treated well, treat yourself well. For example, you don't allow others to abuse you physically or psychologically as there are a lot of means to stop it properly and legally. 2. Be on the lookout when your prejudice strikes. There's nothing wrong if you have an opinion or idea about the person you have just met. However, it has to be balanced with actual facts at hand. If you think that he/she is a person you cannot trust, treat the person well, the same as you treat everyone else, and just reserve your idea to yourself. We have to operate with a logical mind to be fair to other people. 3. Remember that they are also like you as a person. We have our own life and difficulties or problems. Who knows, the person you might be laughing at is suffering from depression. The man you might be trying to discredit is a victim of bullying and physical abuse. Your classmate who always cracks jokes might be trying to forget his dying father. We all have our shortcomings and we are all capable of committing mistakes. The good news is our past does not define us, so learn to keep in mind that people are always a work in progress. 4. Look at the positive side of the person. Despite the imperfections or flaws, there are good things in people that are worth celebrating. Who else does not have any flaw or mistake? We treat people with respect because that's our nature and it defines who we are and not who they are. 5. Always try to be the bigger person. Have a big room for understanding and tolerance for individual differences. Try not to let your emotion get the best of you. You may feel disheartened, angry, jealous or even disappointed with people and that's OK. However, it should not change your nature as a person and the way you relate with them. Keep in mind the insights you got from the negative experiences with other people and use these to improve your dealings with others.​</a>

How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort.

                            14. Directions: Read and analyze very carefully this sample position paper. Then, accomplish the table by doing what are asked. "DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? "Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are effective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016, they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of people with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invested in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smoking. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot. of people to think twice before taking their first puff.Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age.To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there.As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their dangerous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day become more obvious to them too.INTRODUCTION•What is the issue about?•Background • Relevance•Thesis statementBODY•Argument•Counter-argument •Evidences presentedCONCLUSION •Restated position •Course of action presented​</h2><br />

                            18. DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The position paper is about whether anti-smoking ad campaigns really help or not. </p><p>2. The writer's evidences/reasons are that according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers has dropped significantly in recent years, their ads can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff, and they can help parents realize how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. </p><p>3. If I were the writer, my stand would be that anti-smoking ad campaigns are effective because they are able to motivate people to quit smoking and help parents realize the dangers of passive smoking for their kids. The evidence provided by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention also suggests that the number of smokers has declined significantly in the past decade, suggesting that the campaigns are having a positive impact.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

There are plenty of mangoes, avocado, cashew, caimito, santol, macopa, duhat, watermelon, and siniguelas in March, April, and May. June, July and August are atis-gathering time. September and October are months for lanzones, mangosteen, durian, and marang. From November to January, we harvest oranges, rambutan, grapes, chico and pomelo.

D. June, July and August are atis-gathering time. September and October are months for lanzones, mangosteen, durian, and marang.
2. Nutritionists say that our diet should always include fruits. Most fruits are rich in vitamins and minerals. Citrus fruits like oranges and pomelo give Vitamin C but the guava fruit is a very rich source of Vitamin C. Yellow fruits such as mango, tiesa, papaya, and lacatan are rich in Vitamin A which keeps our eyes bright and healthy. Durian and marang, which grow well in Mindanao, are nutritious and are considered aphrodisiacs. WHAT IS THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THIS PARAGRAPH?

3. Fruit trees are proving to be good investment and with agri-business now getting more attention from both the government and private sector, the fruit industry's future looks bright. Among agriculture exports, fruit products have the most promising growth prospects. One indication that investors are turning to fruit-tree growing as money-making venture is the brisk sale of fruit tree seedlings. Report from a new firm specializing in grafted fruit trees shows that an average of 50,000 seedlings are sold per month. WHAT IS THE TOPIC SENTENCE OF THIS PARAGRAPH?

4. Of all the local grown fruit trees, mangoes are the most profitable. Based on the 1998 data from the Bureau of Agriculture, mangoes harvested from a one-hectare lot were valued at P105, 000. Next on the list are lanzones, which yielded fruit worth P75, 000 per hectare in 1998, and citrus jackfruit which grossed P50, 000 per hectare in the same year. Other fruit trees worth investing in are chico, atis, caimito, pili, avocado, guyabano, and cashew. As these trees grow older, they tend to bear more fruit, and this yield means more profit.

THE ISSUE:But in some way or another, the pandemic which caused sudden failures and disappointments in life and labor transforms the ordinary into an extraordinary renewal of what was lost. Strong family ties and relationship was built – evenTiktok videos are well-liked and performed by elders together with their children; the environment is smoothly recovering from pollution and breakage – pollution temporarily halted for a month of locked down; most people cultivated the land – even pots and plastic containers were used to plant for future consumption. Discipline was instilled – most learned how to follow rules and how to wait and give turns to others. Diligence in earning a living and finding means were made satisfied through online selling. Health was even worth the price! - we are even encouraged to wash hands and eat vegetables always. Education had never stopped upon finding means – different learning modalities are offered to us. Concerns and love to one another are fostered – giving and sharing were evident; and most especially our faith and trust in God are restored.We are all taught to adjust ourselves in this New Normal life and everyone is included. And that’s for our good - to keep us safe from harm and to stay alive. As I raised my head, I know that this is just a test of time. A period of everyone’s life to be resilient, cared, hopeful, and prayerful.

What does that mean?Where are the frogs that used to croak around this lake?I can't hear them antmore. There must be some mistake.I wish there was a clock whose hands i could rewind.We might have saved these creatures if we'd just had more time.Time to make people see how we are damaging our Earth,Time to realize what it all was tryly worth.But the animals are dissappearing at an alarming rate.If we don't finally band together,it may really be too late.SAQ-1: Let us try to check your reading comprehension skills by answering the following questions about the poem:1)What are the things that the author wishes to see again?2)Why have they disappeared?3)What can you do to keep the animals' homes like land and waters safe?4)How does the author present the information to make us realize?​</h2><br />

                            27. But in some way or another, the pandemic which caused sudden fallures anddisappointments in life and labor transforms the ordinary into an extraordinary renewalof what was lost. Strong family ties and relationshipwas built - even Tiktok videos arewell-liked and performed by elders together with their children; the environment issmoothly recovering from pollution and breakage - pollution temporarily halted for amonth of locked down; most people cultivated the landeven pots and plasticcontainers were used to plant for future consumption. Discipline was instilled - mostlearned how to follow rules an seed how to wait and giveturns to others. Diligence inearning a living and finding means were made satisfied through online selling. HealthWas even worth thepricel - we are even encouraged to wash hands and eat vegetablesalways.Education had never stopped upon finding means - different learningmodalities are offered to us. Concerns and love to one another are fostered - givingand sharing were evident; andmost especially our faith and trust in God are restored.We are all taught to adjust ourselves in this New Normal life and everyone isincluded. And that's for our good to keep us safe fromharm and to stay alive.As I raised my head, I know that this is just a testof time. A period of everyone's life to be resilient, cared,hopeful, and prayerful. I believe that this pandemic willend the soonest and everything will just be a part of thehistory of human life.​what are the possible cause and effect in this story and possible solution</h2><br />
                        <p>Cause - The animal influenza viruses such as SARS and Covid-19 that has emerges.  </p><p>Effect - it spreads all over the world to humans and animals which causes death. Everyone was been forced to just stay in their respective homes (quarantine) especially children and senior citizens that is more prone in virus. Because of quarantine, as the story says, strong family ties were built,the environment was smoothly recovering from pollution and breakage - pollution temporarily halted because of a month of lock down, Students were being taught through online or modules, and most importantly our faith and trust in God were restored.</p><p>Possible solution - Possible solution is to follow the rules that must be follow to prevent the spread of the virus like always wash hands, always drink water, take vitamins, eat proper foods, don't go outside if there is no important walk, always use mask and face shield when in the outside, social distance to people, and clean the surroundings. If You were exposed like  frontliners from their patients that is positive or when you are experiencing the symptoms, you have to do the 14 days quarantine rule or if possible go to the hospital if you cant handle it anymore. We also need to support each other and help others that are in need. We have to work together to fight the pandemic that was happening. Most importantly Prayers and Faith with God and Jesus Christ His Son.</p><br />

                            28. We respect people not because it is the right thing to do or because you need to do it, rather we co-exist with people and we recognize our similarities and differences. We accept them for who they are and we don't force to change them just to be like us. It's the same thing that they cannot do such to us. The following are just some ways to demonstrate our respect for others: 1. Respect yourself first. You cannot give what you don't have. You cannot control how others would see you but you can shape the way you see yourself. If you think that you deserve to be treated well, treat yourself well. For example, you don't allow others to abuse you physically or psychologically as there are a lot of means to stop it properly and legally. 2. Be on the lookout when your prejudice strikes. There's nothing wrong if you have an opinion or idea about the person you have just met. However, it has to be balanced with actual facts at hand. If you think that he/she is a person you cannot trust, treat the person well, the same as you treat everyone else, and just reserve your idea to yourself. We have to operate with a logical mind to be fair to other people. 3. Remember that they are also like you as a person. We have our own life and difficulties or problems. Who knows, the person you might be laughing at is suffering from depression. The man you might be trying to discredit is a victim of bullying and physical abuse. Your classmate who always cracks jokes might be trying to forget his dying father. We all have our shortcomings and we are all capable of committing mistakes. The good news is our past does not define us, so learn to keep in mind that people are always a work in progress. 4. Look at the positive side of the person. Despite the imperfections or flaws, there are good things in people that are worth celebrating. Who else does not have any flaw or mistake? We treat people with respect because that's our nature and it defines who we are and not who they are. 5. Always try to be the bigger person. Have a big room for understanding and tolerance for individual differences. Try not to let your emotion get the best of you. You may feel disheartened, angry, jealous or even disappointed with people and that's OK. However, it should not change your nature as a person and the way you relate with them. Keep in mind the insights you got from the negative experiences with other people and use these to improve your dealings with others.​</h2><br />
