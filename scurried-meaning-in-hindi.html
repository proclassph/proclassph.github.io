Out of the daily newsroom whirl emerges a remarkable product. In a matter of hours, thousands of words and pictures are put together in a cohesive pattern designed to inform, enlighten, and entertain the reader. To a casual observer, the men and women working in the newsroom may appear to be running about aimlessly amid the clatter of typewriters and the continually ringing telephones. Actually, the scurrying around, the occasional shouting, the general air of excitement are all part of a controlled procedure. Each editor, reporter, and copyboy has a designated job, the end result of which is the newspaper that rolls off the press on time.  QUESTIONS: 1.

                            28. Read the paragraph and answer the following questions.
There are a few places that can boast an act of creation everyday. A newspaper is one of them. Out of the daily newsroom whirl emerges a remarkable product. In a matter of hours, thousands of words and pictures are put together in a cohesive pattern designed to inform, enlighten, and entertain the reader. To a casual observer, the men and women working in the newsroom may appear to be running about aimlessly amid the clatter of typewriters and the continually ringing telephones. Actually, the scurrying around, the occasional shouting, the general air of excitement are all part of a controlled procedure. Each editor, reporter, and copyboy has a designated job, the end result of which is the newspaper that rolls off the press on time.
