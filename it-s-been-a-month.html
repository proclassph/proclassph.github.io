Kim and Lloyd always walk together to school ever since they were inElementary. They share food, toys, secrets and even assignments. When one is not feeling well, the other would volunteer to take care. When one is angry the other just keeps quiet. They also have their petty quarrels but they will not end their day without discussing their differences.Theme/s:__________2. Jimmy and his young sister woke up early and walked on foot towards the pile of garbage to look for things to be recycled and sold. After almost two hours of going through the heap of garbage, the children hurriedly walked to Mang Nato's bodega to sell their items collected for the day. They were paid fifty pesos enough to buy for breakfast for their hungry stomach. The rest of the day, they will be picking vegetables in the market to earn some more money to buy food for lunch and dinner for their sick mother who is left home.Theme/s:__________3. During the gold rush, a man who had been mining in Colorado for severalmonths quit his job, as he hadn't struck gold yet and the work was becomingtiresome. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it had been left off. The new miner was advised by his engineer that there was gold only three feet away from where the first miner stopped digging. The engineer was right, which means the first miner was a mere threefeet away from striking gold before he quit.Theme/s:__________​</a>

During the gold rush, a man who had been mining in colorado for several months quit his job, as he hadn't struck gold yet and the work was becoming tiresome. He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it had been left off. The new miner was advised by his engineer that there was gold only three feet away from where the first miner stopped digging. The engineer was right, which means the first miner was a mere three feet away from striking gold before he quit.

How The Philippines Is Fighting COVID-19
After more than three months of hard lockdowns, the Philippines is now trying to
ease quarantine restrictions for its economy to bounce back. While the focus is on saving
lives and looking after the health and well-being of every Filipino, developing economies
like the Philippines with a population of around 109 million people - a high percentage of
which come from hand-to-mouth households simply cannot afford the use of
containment measures like hard lockdowns for the entire country indefinitely. Hence, the
government has considered steps to safety and gradually reopen the economy.
-
As the Philippines reopens its economy by easing out restrictions after successful
lockdowns, it has experienced a reversed trend in the number of COVID-19 positive cases.
The number of deaths has been reduced to single-digit, while the number of positive cases
has increased significantly to three-digit.
This reversal is somewhat expected because more people are now back on the
streets. One of the contributing factors to the rise in COVID-19 positive cases is the influx
of returning Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), of which some have tested positive upon
arrival in the Philippines. For instance, as of July 2, out of the 99,353 returning OFWS, 2,424
were confirmed as being COVID-19 positive.</a>

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of all learners in thePhilippines since March. There have been many stories of learners being concernedby the spread of the deadly virus as schools across the country were closed. This isthe first pandemic to have had a huge impact on education not only in the Philippinesbut across the world.(2) Countries like South Korea and France have been forced to close their schools shortly after they re-opened due to increase in coronavirus cases. In the Philippines, while the government and health officials are trying to flatten the curve of the deadly virus, the Department of Education  is working hard to transition the modality of teaching from conventional "face-to-face" learning to so called "blended learning."

                                            The scenario A month ago you started a new job as finance director of a small company, Hypothetical Marketing. Your previous job was at a large office supplies company, Paperclips123, where you worked in the finance department and were involved in developing strategy and producing the annual report. Hypothetical Marketing has a contract with Paperclips123 to supply all office supplies, and the contract is up for renewal. The head of procurement, Sofia, asks you for a meeting to discuss the contract renewal. This isn’t out of the ordinary — you know that part of your new role is to discuss any important contract renewals with Sofia to ensure you’re on the same page on budget and key contract clauses. In the meeting, Sofia asks you for your take on Paperclips123’s current financial performance and strategy. She thinks that the company might be willing to compromise on price in return for better payment terms — there has been a rumour that Paperclips123 has cash flow issues and needs to get some cash into the business quickly. She reminds you that Hypothetical Marketing is struggling a bit at the moment and saving some money on this contract could be really helpful for the company. She also tells you that it would be beneficial for you if you could help the company save somemoney so early in your employment. You know lots about the situation at Paperclips123 — you wrote its financial strategy just a couple of months ago! Can you share with Sofia some information about Paperclips123?​</a>

How The Philippines Is Fighting COVID-19
After more than three months of hard lockdowns, the Philippines is now trying to
ease quarantine restrictions for its economy to bounce back. While the focus is on saving
lives and looking after the health and well-being of every Filipino, developing economies
like the Philippines with a population of around 109 million people - a high percentage of
which come from hand-to-mouth households simply cannot afford the use of
containment measures like hard lockdowns for the entire country indefinitely. Hence, the
government has considered steps to safety and gradually reopen the economy.
-
As the Philippines reopens its economy by easing out restrictions after successful
lockdowns, it has experienced a reversed trend in the number of COVID-19 positive cases.
The number of deaths has been reduced to single-digit, while the number of positive cases
has increased significantly to three-digit.
This reversal is somewhat expected because more people are now back on the
streets. One of the contributing factors to the rise in COVID-19 positive cases is the influx
of returning Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), of which some have tested positive upon
arrival in the Philippines. For instance, as of July 2, out of the 99,353 returning OFWS, 2,424
were confirmed as being COVID-19 positive.</h2><br />

                            28. The scenario A month ago you started a new job as finance director of a small company, Hypothetical Marketing. Your previous job was at a large office supplies company, Paperclips123, where you worked in the finance department and were involved in developing strategy and producing the annual report. Hypothetical Marketing has a contract with Paperclips123 to supply all office supplies, and the contract is up for renewal. The head of procurement, Sofia, asks you for a meeting to discuss the contract renewal. This isn’t out of the ordinary — you know that part of your new role is to discuss any important contract renewals with Sofia to ensure you’re on the same page on budget and key contract clauses. In the meeting, Sofia asks you for your take on Paperclips123’s current financial performance and strategy. She thinks that the company might be willing to compromise on price in return for better payment terms — there has been a rumour that Paperclips123 has cash flow issues and needs to get some cash into the business quickly. She reminds you that Hypothetical Marketing is struggling a bit at the moment and saving some money on this contract could be really helpful for the company. She also tells you that it would be beneficial for you if you could help the company save somemoney so early in your employment. You know lots about the situation at Paperclips123 — you wrote its financial strategy just a couple of months ago! Can you share with Sofia some information about Paperclips123?​</h2><br />
