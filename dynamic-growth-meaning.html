But there are people who wonder why economic growth has not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest. Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks. ​</p>

DIRECTION: Read the academic texts below and summarize them using the
listed procedures. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.
A. With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended
to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrolment in senior high
school (SHS), which will comprise Grade 11 and 12, is expected to increase to
2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in
school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for
the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12
program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected
demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as
possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the
additional demand for places in SHSs.
B. Filipino women are active as entrepreneurs. Data from the Department of Trade
and Industry for 2009 show that 54 percent of enterprises are owned by women.
This Policy Note discusses the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. To
achieve inclusively growth in the Asia- Pacific region, it is critical to increase the
economic opportunities of women in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies. APEC members must take national-level and regional
actions toward creating enabling environments for women enterprises and
empowering women entrepreneurs. The significant number of women
entrepreneurs reflects the huge potential of women to make substantial
contributions to the national economy. For this to be realized, they need to be
supported through appropriate and timely interventions toward growing and
scaling up their business.
C. The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global
economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has
not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also
barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by
economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.
Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to
capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to
make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in
official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction
has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that
provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the
country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more
likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been
vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only
be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist
those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.</a>

Climate change is a change in climate patterns attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. Read and analyze the speech of former Secretary of Department of Natural Resources (DENR), Gina Lopez, about climate change at a conference in Marrakech, Morocco on November 17, 2016. After reading, answer the questions that follow. Do not forget to place your answers on your answer sheet. "Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life, some of which includes a snail - the venom of which has been found by a Nobel laureate to be better than morphine in addressing pain without the side effects. Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer, and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees, we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. We need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of 8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. So much to give. So much to lose. As the Secretary for the environment, I say we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. We will also plant bamboo - which is superb in carbon sequestration. But this bamboo can also build strong six story buildings, low-cost housing, floor tiles, textiles, clean our polluted waterways. In essence, adaptation, mitigation, inclusive economic growth does not have to be separate activities or choices. These objectives can all be achieved given the right approach. Because the Philippines is in the "firing line" of climate change. I propose that we be one venue for scientists as we explore ways for humanity to move forward. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message - it can be done, and we can do it! There is an integration of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non-negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future.Judging the Author's Reasoning: Answer the following questions.​</a>

DIRECTION: Read the academic texts below and summarize them using the
listed procedures. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.
A. With the enactment of the K to 12 program, the basic education cycle is extended
to include two additional years at the secondary level. Enrolment in senior high
school (SHS), which will comprise Grade 11 and 12, is expected to increase to
2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in
school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for
the SHS program. This Policy Note does an initial assessment of the K to 12
program’s effect on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected
demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as
possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the
additional demand for places in SHSs.
B. Filipino women are active as entrepreneurs. Data from the Department of Trade
and Industry for 2009 show that 54 percent of enterprises are owned by women.
This Policy Note discusses the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs. To
achieve inclusively growth in the Asia- Pacific region, it is critical to increase the
economic opportunities of women in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) economies. APEC members must take national-level and regional
actions toward creating enabling environments for women enterprises and
empowering women entrepreneurs. The significant number of women
entrepreneurs reflects the huge potential of women to make substantial
contributions to the national economy. For this to be realized, they need to be
supported through appropriate and timely interventions toward growing and
scaling up their business.
C. The Philippines has recently experienced economic growth despite the global
economic slowdown. But there are people who wonder why economic growth has
not translated into poverty reduction. The levels of income inequality have also
barely changed, a pattern that could mean new opportunities created by
economic growth do not allow the income of the poor to catch up with the rest.
Inequality is a natural outcome of economic growth since people with access to
capital are more likely to reap the benefits of growth first. What is critical is to
make economic growth truly inclusive. This Policy Note examines trends in
official (monetary) poverty statistics. It is also looks into why poverty reduction
has been historically lackluster in the Philippines using available panel data that
provide information on dynamics of household welfare and living conditions in the
country. It pointed out that in the period 2003-2009, poor Filipinos were more
likely to experience higher income growth, but some non-poor have also been
vulnerable to slide in to poverty. This suggests that government should not only
be concerned with the poor but should also have policy instruments to assist
those who are non-poor but plagued by economic risks.</h2><br />

                            7. Activity: Judge a Speech: Read the text to answer the given activities. Climate change is a change in climate patterns attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. Read and analyze the speech of former Secretary of Department of Natural Resources (DENR), Gina Lopez, about climate change at a conference in Marrakech, Morocco on November 17, 2016. After reading, answer the questions that follow. Do not forget to place your answers on your answer sheet. "Greetings! The Philippines is a country of 7 thousand islands which has the highest endemicity per unit area in the planet. This means that 70 percent of the biodiversity found in the Philippines can only be found in our country. We have more than 3000 species of marine life, some of which includes a snail - the venom of which has been found by a Nobel laureate to be better than morphine in addressing pain without the side effects. Our sponges and shells are effective in addressing cancer, and we are barely scratching the surface of what there is. This is not just the wealth of the Philippines - it is the wealth of all of us together. Should the planet escalate to more than 1.5 degrees, we lose all of that. The planet simply cannot afford an indecisive ambiguity about what needs to be done. The situation is clear - anything more than 1.5 degrees will destroy possibilities for quality of life. We do not need to give up economic growth - from clean energy to sustainable transportation, to all facets of life. We need to have the courage to change the way we do things. We cannot and must not build an economy based on suffering. At an increase of 8 degrees, we suffered Typhoon Haiyan, which is the worst storm surge in the planets history wherein more than ten thousand died. Ironic. So much to give. So much to lose. As the Secretary for the environment, I say we will go heavily into mangroves because the islands with mangroves suffered 80 percent less damage in terms of lives and property. This thrust will not only save our islands but will result in economic zones because of the resultant increase in fish, shrimps, and other sea life. If handled well, our people can get out of poverty. We will also plant bamboo - which is superb in carbon sequestration. But this bamboo can also build strong six story buildings, low-cost housing, floor tiles, textiles, clean our polluted waterways. In essence, adaptation, mitigation, inclusive economic growth does not have to be separate activities or choices. These objectives can all be achieved given the right approach. Because the Philippines is in the "firing line" of climate change. I propose that we be one venue for scientists as we explore ways for humanity to move forward. I propose a dynamic direction of facilitating climate change models on the ground that give the message - it can be done, and we can do it! There is an integration of life. Yesterday, I was in awe at dynamism and non-negotiable commitment of the leaders of the Climate Change movement. If we all imbibe this consciousness deep in our hearts and manifest it in ground level reality - humanity faces a bright future if we continue to bloom this spirit of working together. The Philippines is making a commitment to this exciting future.Judging the Author's Reasoning: Answer the following questions.​</h2><br />
