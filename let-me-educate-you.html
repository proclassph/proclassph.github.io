                                            - despite these arguments, if we put these ideas on the affirmative side, we can tell that the educational system in our country improved. Yes, I cannot deny the fact that with these changes in the system teachers have been negatively affected.
- But if look deeper and realize without these changes new opportunities of educational institution including teachers will not be open. 
- let me give you some examples: as the years passed educational system of the Philippines is nit that good enough compare to the other country. In short education here were left behind
- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
- students were challenged to use different ways of getting information and achieving knowledge on their own and that makes them become independent.
To put things in context, the educational system had given an opportunity to us and the teachers. let's not focus on the negative side because after all we did not achieved these levels of knowledge without the changes of the system itself.

- curriculum and teaching instructions were not properly developed and teachers knowledge and new opportunities is not spotted.
- But now as you can see, since the day that Deped started its blending its progress with the other country things got better in terms of knowledge and opportunities both teachers and students
- They were able to harness their capability in technology, and broaden their knowledge because of the challenges given by our educational system
- old and traditional way of teaching improved and knowledge given by books were modernized into online which makes us became more flexible
- teachers were given an opportunity to expose and use their skills and creativity just to make teaching more in when it comes to the new era.
