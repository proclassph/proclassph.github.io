Directions: Read the following speech and then answer the given questions below
"If you are going to be leaders, there are three important things to do. First, really know yourselves and what is going on in our country. In spite of differences, you all belong to one nation. Second, develop a sense of commitment to the Philippines. Commitment means much more than just standing up to the national anthem. It means contributing something to the progress and development of the Philippines no matter how small it is. It means doing your work faithfully and well. It also means upholding the ideals and heritage of the Filipino nation. Third, respect each other and work well with each other. You are going to be leaders of this country and you are here as individuals sincerely trying to develop yourselves, commit yourselves to the Philippines, and uphold the ideals of freedom and democracy. As good leaders, you should be able to think for yourselves, and stand on your own feet. Be responsible, honest, hardworking, patriotic, and just."

                                            Space: The future of tourism? When William Shatner finally got to fly to space aboard one of Blue Origin's New Shepard rockets on Oct. 14, 2021, he didn't just become the oldest human being to have ever done so (at 90 years old), he also helped bring the future of space tourism closer to reality Just this year, a number of spaceflight or aeronautics companies have started testing their respective rockets and spaceships - because that's what they really are, ships that fly into space or near-Earth orbit - with actual humans onboard. While this isn't the first time a human being has flown into space, this is the first time ordinary persons, meaning not technically trained astronauts, have flown into space. It might be difficult to imagine how this is an exciting moment, with most of the world still mired by the ongoing pandemic.

It will promote a clean and healthy environment to live in. The rubbish we throw away everyday can creates waste. Recycling means that there is less rubbish, which makes our environment cleaner and healthier Besides recycling saves raw materials. The more we recycle the few raw materials we need. Definitely, it can help to save wild places and the animals that they live in them. Recycling papers, for example means that fewer timber forests are needed As stewards of the environment we are responsible for preserving and protecting our resources. We should take care our environment not only for ourselves but for future generations. Based on the reasons stated above. I believe that recycling is really important to be done now.

It will promote a clean and healthy environment to live in. The rubbish we throw away everyday can creates waste. Recycling means that there is less rubbish, which makes our environment cleaner and healthier. Besides, recycling saves raw materials. The more we recycle, the few raw materials we need. Definitely, it can help to save wild places and the animals that they live in them. Recycling papers, for example, means that fewer timber forests are needed. As stewards of the environment, we are responsible for preserving and protecting our resources. We should take care our environment not only for ourselves but for future generations. Based on the reasons stated above, I believe that recycling is really important to be done now. Topic: High Modality Words: Language of Opinion:​</a>

Directions: Read the following speech and then answer the given questions below
"If you are going to be leaders, there are three important things to do. First, really know yourselves and what is going on in our country. In spite of differences, you all belong to one nation. Second, develop a sense of commitment to the Philippines. Commitment means much more than just standing up to the national anthem. It means contributing something to the progress and development of the Philippines no matter how small it is. It means doing your work faithfully and well. It also means upholding the ideals and heritage of the Filipino nation. Third, respect each other and work well with each other. You are going to be leaders of this country and you are here as individuals sincerely trying to develop yourselves, commit yourselves to the Philippines, and uphold the ideals of freedom and democracy. As good leaders, you should be able to think for yourselves, and stand on your own feet. Be responsible, honest, hardworking, patriotic, and just."

When William Shatner finally got to fly to space aboard one of Blue Origin's New Shepard rockets on Oct. 14, 2021, he didn't just become the oldest human being to have ever done so (at 90 years old), he also helped bring the future of space tourism closer to reality Just this year, a number of spaceflight or aeronautics companies have started testing their respective rockets and spaceships - because that's what they really are, ships that fly into space or near-Earth orbit - with actual humans onboard. While this isn't the first time a human being has flown into space, this is the first time ordinary persons, meaning not technically trained astronauts, have flown into space. It might be difficult to imagine how this is an exciting moment, with most of the world still mired by the ongoing pandemic.

Use the graphic organizer below. Do this activity in your English notebook. Recycling, why is it important? Recycling is important to be done. It will promote a clean and healthy environment to live in. The rubbish we throw away everyday can creates waste. Recycling means that there is less rubbish, which makes our environment cleaner and healthier. Besides, recycling saves raw materials. The more we recycle, the few raw materials we need. Definitely, it can help to save wild places and the animals that they live in them. Recycling papers, for example, means that fewer timber forests are needed. As stewards of the environment, we are responsible for preserving and protecting our resources. We should take care our environment not only for ourselves but for future generations. Based on the reasons stated above, I believe that recycling is really important to be done now. Topic: High Modality Words: Language of Opinion:​</h2><br />
