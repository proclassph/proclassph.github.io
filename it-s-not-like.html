They are not like tiny marbles rubbing around each other, but like sticks or strands of straw.<br /><br />With low shear force, they are not compressed enough to turn into a solid. They can still slip by each other easily. The water may provide the "grease" that keeps them from sticking in this state.<br /><br />With higher shear forces, they lock into one another and form a solid.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer with Explanation:</p><p>1. The maximum number of people who liked Brand H shampoo and Brand S shampoo is 35.</p><p></p><p>Explanation: In order to obtain the answer, we will not use complex formulas here. We will just use our common sense. As we can see in the given problem, among 100 people surveyed about their shampoo preferences, 50 people liked Brand H while 35 liked the other shampoo brand which is the Brand S. Since there are only 35 people who liked Brand S, we can say that a maximum of 35 people liked both brands. We could possibly have 35 people or less who liked the Brand S. If our answer is 50 people, it is impossible to say this since there are only 35 people in favor of the Brand S.</p><p></p><p>2. The maximum number of people who do not like any brand is 50.</p><p></p><p>Explanation: Since there are 50 people who liked brand H, there is a possibility also that within those 50 are the people also who preferred Brand S. If there were 100 people surveyed, we will just subtract 50 from 100. Hence, there are at most 50 people who did not like either of the shampoo brands.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po</p><br />

PLIANT LIKE THE BAMBOO
by Ismael Mallari


"Bayanihan" by Joselito E. Barcelona

There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.

The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.

The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.

The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.

And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.

  
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.

Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.

And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.

  
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.

This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.

He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

  
Everywhere about him is a lesson in patience and forbearance that he does not have to learn with difficulty. For the Filipino lives in a country on which the gods lavished their gifts aplenty. He does not have to worry about the morrow. Tomorrow will be only another day—no winter of discontent. Of he loses his possessions, there is the land and there is the sea, with all the riches that one can desire. There is plenty to spar—for friends, for neighbors and for everyone else.

No woner that the Filipino can afford to laugh. For the Filipino is endowed with saving grace of humor. This humor is earthly as befits one who has not indulged in deep contemplation. But it has enabled the Filipino to shrug his shoulders in times of adversity and say to himself “Bahala na”*.

The Filipino has often been accused of being indolent and of lacking initiative. And he has answered back* that no one can help being indolent and lacking in initiative who lives under the torrid sun which saps the vitality.

This seeming lack of vitality is, however, only one og his means of survival. He does not allow the world to be too much with him. Like the bamboo tree, he lets the winds of chance and circumstance blow all about him; and he is unperturbed and serene.
