The doctors and hospitals are better able to keep up with treating those who need care. During this health crisis, it's best to take a "better safe than sorry" approach. This means that keeping your family home and away from others as much as possible. Don't have friends and extended family over, and don't go to their homes. People who look healthy still can be infected and can spread the virus. Certainly, it is important to stay away from everyone, even if they don't seem sick. If you're caring for someone who is sick, take all recommended precautions. Te's important to keep that person away from others.

The best way to fight this spread is for everyone to practice social distancing and stay home. Social distancing puts space between people. When people who are infected with the virus stay away from others, they can't pass it to anyone else. In that came, fewer people get sick at the same time. The doctors and hospitals are better able to keep up with treating those who need care. During this health crisis, it's best to take a "better safe than sorry" approach. This means that keeping your family home and away from others as much as possible. Don't have friends and extended family over, and don't go to their homes. People who look healthy still can be infected and can spread the virus. Certainly, it is important to stay away from everyone, even if they don't seem sick. If you're caring for someone who is sick, take all recommended precautions. Te's important to keep that person away from others.
