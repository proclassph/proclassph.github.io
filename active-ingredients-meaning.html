                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1,Aristotle. WE find happiness with our friends, if we expect it there.</p><p>2,Happiness depends on ourselves.” More than anybody else, Aristotle enshrines happiness as a central purpose of human life and a goal in itself. As a result he devotes more space to the topic of happiness than any thinker prior to the modern era.</p><p>3,Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfaction, contentment, and fulfillment.</p><p>4,Happiness is the perfection of human nature. Since man is a rational animal, human happiness depends on the exercise of his reason. Happiness depends on acquiring a moral character, where one displays the virtues of courage, generosity, justice, friendship, and citizenship in one's life.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Yun Lang Sana nakatulung </p><p>take care of yourself okay </p><br />
