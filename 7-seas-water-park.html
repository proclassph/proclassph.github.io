                                            an amazing place in Japan. Artificial Beaches, Anyone? Although Japan is surrounded by sea, the waters are not great for swimming. They are too cold to be enjoyed most of the year. They are dangerous not only because of the strong undercurrents but also because of big sharks. But Japan has come up with a high-tech solution. It has produced artificial beaches inside very big domes. Yes, artificial beaches complete with rocks, sand, palm trees, waters at right temperature, and even waves. One such artificial beach is the Ocean Dome of Phoenix Seagaia Resort which opened in 1993. Located in Miyazaki City on Kyushu Island, it is the world's biggest indoor water park. The scene inside the dome is like a Caribbean Island with realistic (beaches, palm trees, rocks, waves, and sand. The sand is actually very finely crushed marble. There is an equipment that produces artificial waves and another that creates day or evening scenes when necessary. Another indoor water park was the Wild Blue Yokohama which opened in June 1992. It looked very natural with its own original system of generating continuous waves. It had more of a tropical atmosphere. Young people gathered here to enjoy summer even in winter. But can these artificial beaches be better than the real ones? What do all these mean to us, Filipinos? For one thing, these remind us how lucky and blessed we are. We have been endowed by God with many fascinating beaches. Let us take very good care of our beaches because if they lose their natural beauty, we may be forced to import another product from Japan-artificial beaches! Heaven forbid! Think It Over I. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Source: Money-Saver Magazine, April 1994 How are the seas surrounding Japan described in the selection? How did Japan solve its problem with its beaches? What is the world's biggest indoor water park? Where is it located? Where do young people in Japan gather to have fun during summer or even in winter? What is the scene inside the Dome of Miyazaki like? What do all these man-made beaches remind us Filipinos? What does the article aim to tell us? What may happen if we do not care for our beaches? ​</a>

                            14. an amazing place in Japan. Artificial Beaches, Anyone? Although Japan is surrounded by sea, the waters are not great for swimming. They are too cold to be enjoyed most of the year. They are dangerous not only because of the strong undercurrents but also because of big sharks. But Japan has come up with a high-tech solution. It has produced artificial beaches inside very big domes. Yes, artificial beaches complete with rocks, sand, palm trees, waters at right temperature, and even waves. One such artificial beach is the Ocean Dome of Phoenix Seagaia Resort which opened in 1993. Located in Miyazaki City on Kyushu Island, it is the world's biggest indoor water park. The scene inside the dome is like a Caribbean Island with realistic (beaches, palm trees, rocks, waves, and sand. The sand is actually very finely crushed marble. There is an equipment that produces artificial waves and another that creates day or evening scenes when necessary. Another indoor water park was the Wild Blue Yokohama which opened in June 1992. It looked very natural with its own original system of generating continuous waves. It had more of a tropical atmosphere. Young people gathered here to enjoy summer even in winter. But can these artificial beaches be better than the real ones? What do all these mean to us, Filipinos? For one thing, these remind us how lucky and blessed we are. We have been endowed by God with many fascinating beaches. Let us take very good care of our beaches because if they lose their natural beauty, we may be forced to import another product from Japan-artificial beaches! Heaven forbid! Think It Over I. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Source: Money-Saver Magazine, April 1994 How are the seas surrounding Japan described in the selection? How did Japan solve its problem with its beaches? What is the world's biggest indoor water park? Where is it located? Where do young people in Japan gather to have fun during summer or even in winter?
