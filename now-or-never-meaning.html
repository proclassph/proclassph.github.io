                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Story: Be Indifferent</p><p></p><p>Once upon a time, an old man and a young man were traveling together with their donkey to a far place. As they passed through villages, towns, and fields, people looked at them with curiosity and made comments about the way they treated the donkey.</p><p></p><p>The old man rode on the donkey while the young man walked. Some people said that it was not right for the old man to make the young man walk while he rode the donkey. So the old man got down and let the young man ride the donkey. But then other people said that it was not right for the young man to ride while the old man walked. So the young man got down and let the old man ride the donkey.</p><p></p><p>As they continued on their journey, they met other people who commented on their treatment of the donkey. Some people said that they were cruel to the donkey for making it carry both of them. Other people said that they were foolish for not taking advantage of the donkey's strength and making it carry both of them.</p><p></p><p>The old and young man tried to please everyone along the way, but they received different reactions from the people they met. Some were helpful, while others were not. They became confused and frustrated, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, the old man said to the young man, "If you go on listening to everybody, everybody will be prodding you to this way or that. You will never be able to reach your innermost center." They realized that they should be indifferent to what other people said and just do what they thought was right.</p><p></p><p>Questions:</p><p></p><p>1. The problem of the old man and young man as they traveled to a far place was that people kept making comments about the way they treated the donkey, and they tried to please everyone along the way.</p><p>2. The people they met were the ones who made comments about the way they treated the donkey.</p><p>3. The old and young man received different reactions along the way. Some people were helpful, while others were not. They became confused and frustrated.</p><p>4. You should not listen to everything that anybody says because people have different opinions and perspectives. What is right for one person may not be right for another.</p><p>5. When the old man said, "If you go on listening to everybody, everybody will be prodding you to this way or that. You will never be able to reach your innermost center," he meant that if you try to please everyone and listen to what they say, you will lose sight of what is truly important to you. You need to be true to yourself and follow your own path, even if it means going against what others think or say.</p><br />

The speaker reflects on the past seven months and seven years of their life, and how they have come to realize the heavy weight of responsibility that comes with being an adult in a tough and sometimes mad world. They have learned that many of the things they were taught about love, success, and goals were just lies, and that they now have a hollow soul. Despite this, the speaker acknowledges that they now know the reality of being an adult, and that they must face it head on, even if they don't know where to go from here.</p><br />
