                                            the moon's phase depends only on its position relative to earth and the Sun. the changes of the moon's appearance are what we called the phases of the moon but it doesn't mean that the moon itself changes its shape but it is actually the lighted part. then we see less and less of its lighted part that is why its shape appears to change and again it is called "phases of the moon".Questions:1. What do you call the changes of the moon's appearance?2. Why does the appearance of the moon seem to differ in shape?3. How do phases of the moon happen? ​</a>

Suddenly the rabbi got up, took his hand, and carried it to the window overlooking the street."Tell me, what do you see?" the rabbi asked."I see people," replied the puzzled rich man.Then the rabbi drew him in front of the mirror, "What do you see now?" he againquestion him.= "I see myself," the man replied, confused.“Now, my son, let me explain to you the meaning of my two questions.The window is made of glass, as well as glass, only the glass glass has a silver gloss on it. When you look through simple glasses you see people. But you don’t immediately cover it with silver when you stop looking at others and you only see yourself. "1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. What word other than rich describes the man? 3. Why did the rich man ask for the blessing? 4. the rabbi believes you can be happy if you can share your blessing with others. in your own way, how can you make yourself happy?​</a>

                                            Meaning of Parable of Stones by Gemino H. AbadParable of StonesEvery time I go intothe world’s morning, my pocketsare full of stones.You cannot see themwhere my hands are hid,sometimes bruised by their edge.And a quick and deadly aimI have, and ask no questions.My hands are cold.And few stones left I haveat each day’s end,and groan as my hands bleed.My state — who can endure?As morning breaks, I know againI have more stones to cast.You cannot see themwhere my hands closeand all my days bleed.Who will close my morning?O, who will emptymy pockets of my stones?— by Gemino H. Abad​</a>
