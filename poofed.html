                                            SELECTION 2 C For Conversation, Press # 1 by Michael Alvear A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, you can just insert your card into the ATM. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets auto- mated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn't an option---they're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm home. Readers Digest, pp. 143-145, July 2000 Questions: 1. What is your understanding on this passage: "Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel?" 2. Why do you think the author came up with this kind of article? 3. Upon reading the article, do you agree with the author's opinion? Why or why not?​</a>

Here, I do search a good poem about FRICTION, let us get the message and capture ideas from the poem entitled "A World Without Friction".A World Without FrictionBy: Gloson TheIn class, I was taught about friction.It keeps us on my feet.And if there were no friction, I'd be sliding off my seat!So, what if there ain't friction?Things would just slip like ice!Gravity will make things slide, which isn't very nice.In a world without friction, things would be topsy-turvies': I'm sliding off my seat right now. without the friction's service! I can't stop sliding down. There is no way to stop! I'm sliding to five small round bumps! Bap, bop, bop, bop, boplOuch! That hurt. And now I'm hungry. I will need a snack. Yes, here comes a yummy burger sliding to my back!Hooray! It's in my hands. Oh wait... the friction isn't near. The burger's slipping off my hands, It's sliding out of here!I'm sliding like the floors were ice; I cannot stop at all! Oh no! Now I am heading right into a red brick wall!Now, how do you get out of this imaginary world? Just stop imagining! And "POOF!" into my seat I'm hurled.Phee-ew! What an absurd adventure- A non-fiction fiction! And all that I can say now is, I'm glad that there is friction.​</a>

The prince was mean and rude towards the people of his kingdom. He mocked and made fun of all the girls that he saw along his way. One day a visitor arrived in the kingdom. It was an old ugly woman. When he saw the visitor the prince laughed so hard and mocked the old woman. The old woman got angry and pointed her finger at the prince and cast a spell. "I will turn you into an ugly black rabbit for being such a mean and bad mannered person. Poof! the prince instantly turned into a black rabbit. "Only when someone takes pity and sheds a tear for you will the spell be broken." On the other side of the kingdom there was a river and on its riverbank was the house of a beautiful girl named Felicia. She was a beautiful and kindhearted girl. Every morning Felicia would go to the river to wash their clothes. One day as she washed their clothes, she saw a black dirty rabbit. She picked up the rabbit and bathed it in the water. She felt pity for the poor rabbit so, she decided to bring the rabbit to her house. As she walked towards home she met an old woman. When the old woman saw the rabbit she claimed that the rabbit was hers. She asked Felicia to give her the rabbit. But the rabbit cried and held on tightly to Felicia's arms. The old woman got angry and turned herself into an evil witch. "Give me my Rabbit! I am Its master!" But Felicia was not afraid of the witch. She did not let go the rabbit. Instead she fought the witch with all her might. As Felicia and the witch were fighting, they didn't notice that the rabbit fell into the water. Felicia did not hesitate to swim into the water and save the drowning rabbit.. Oh my poor, dear rabbit please wake up", she said as she hugged the dying rabbit. She was crying so hard that her tears fell onto the rabbit's body. Suddenly the rabbit turned into a handsome prince. The prince thanked her for saving his life.

                                            Activity 4. Read to Find the Evidence Read the text below, then answer the questions that follow. For Conversation, Press #1by Michael Alvear I’ve got a cell phone, e-mail, and voice mail. So why am I so lonely? A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and–poof!–I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.  The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Recently I was in a car with three friends. The driver shushed the rest of us because he could not hear the person on the other end of his cell phone. There we were, four friends zooming down the highway, unable to talk to one another because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.  Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.  As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. You can’t even call a person to get the phone number of another person anymore. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated.  Pumping gas at the station? Why say good- morning to the attendant when you can swipe your credit card at the pump and save yourself the bother of human contact?  Making a deposit at the bank? Why talk to a clerk who might live in the neighborhood when you can just insert your card into the ATM?  Pretty soon you won’t have the burden of making eye contact at the grocery store. Some supermarket chains are using a self-scanner so you can check yourself out, avoiding those annoying clerks who look at you and ask how you are doing.  I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, an e-mail account. Giving them up isn’t an option–they’re great for what they’re intended to do. It’s their unintended consequences that make me cringe. More and more, I find myself hiding behind e-mail to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail picked up because I didn’t really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier–or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I’ve put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I’m home.  What good is all this gee-whiz technology if there’s no one in the room to hear you exclaim, “Gee whiz”?A.

Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching
her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the
sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the
doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books
and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye
and when she came near the point at which our ways
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This
happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her,
except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a
summons to all my foolish blood.
-excerpt from Araby by James Joyce

                            10. SELECTION 2 C For Conversation, Press # 1 by Michael Alvear A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, you can just insert your card into the ATM. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets auto- mated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn't an option---they're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm home. Readers Digest, pp. 143-145, July 2000 Questions: 1. What is your understanding on this passage: "Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel?" 2. Why do you think the author came up with this kind of article? 3. Upon reading the article, do you agree with the author's opinion? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Due to less connectivity with the people and belongingness there is a loneliness and depression creates in a human technology is one of the main cause these days that creates disconnected from everyone and there will remain no social life.</p><p></p><p>2. I believe that the author came up with this kind of article is to remind us that because of our addiction to gadgets nowadays, we don't enjoy life as much as possible. Remember, we only live once so we need to savor and enjoy every single moment-memorable or horrible.</p><p></p><p>3. I strongly agree with the author's opinion. As a person who also became addicted to my phone and social media that sometimes I forget to do important tasks like studying. I also don't get to enjoy life. I remember that whenever we would travel, I would always be on my phone or I would be looking for wifi. But I think the beauty of traveling allows me to leave my gadgets and appreciate the world. Our gadgets may be useful right now with online classes and research.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Credits:FTO</p><br />

Here, I do search a good poem about FRICTION, let us get the message and capture ideas from the poem entitled "A World Without Friction".A World Without FrictionBy: Gloson TheIn class, I was taught about friction.It keeps us on my feet.And if there were no friction, I'd be sliding off my seat!So, what if there ain't friction?Things would just slip like ice!Gravity will make things slide, which isn't very nice.In a world without friction, things would be topsy-turvies': I'm sliding off my seat right now. without the friction's service! I can't stop sliding down. There is no way to stop! I'm sliding to five small round bumps! Bap, bop, bop, bop, boplOuch! That hurt. And now I'm hungry. I will need a snack. Yes, here comes a yummy burger sliding to my back!Hooray! It's in my hands. Oh wait... the friction isn't near. The burger's slipping off my hands, It's sliding out of here!I'm sliding like the floors were ice; I cannot stop at all! Oh no! Now I am heading right into a red brick wall!Now, how do you get out of this imaginary world? Just stop imagining! And "POOF!" into my seat I'm hurled.Phee-ew! What an absurd adventure- A non-fiction fiction! And all that I can say now is, I'm glad that there is friction.​</h2><br />

                            16. Read the story and identify the elements found in the story.          ☛The Black Rabbit ☚A long time ago in a faraway kingdom, there lived a handsome but cruel prince. The prince was mean and rude towards the people of his kingdom. He mocked and made fun of all the girls that he saw along his way. One day a visitor arrived in the kingdom. It was an old ugly woman. When he saw the visitor the prince laughed so hard and mocked the old woman. The old woman got angry and pointed her finger at the prince and cast a spell. "I will turn you into an ugly black rabbit for being such a mean and bad mannered person. Poof! the prince instantly turned into a black rabbit. "Only when someone takes pity and sheds a tear for you will the spell be broken." On the other side of the kingdom there was a river and on its riverbank was the house of a beautiful girl named Felicia. She was a beautiful and kindhearted girl. Every morning Felicia would go to the river to wash their clothes. One day as she washed their clothes, she saw a black dirty rabbit. She picked up the rabbit and bathed it in the water. She felt pity for the poor rabbit so, she decided to bring the rabbit to her house. As she walked towards home she met an old woman. When the old woman saw the rabbit she claimed that the rabbit was hers. She asked Felicia to give her the rabbit. But the rabbit cried and held on tightly to Felicia's arms. The old woman got angry and turned herself into an evil witch. "Give me my Rabbit! I am Its master!" But Felicia was not afraid of the witch. She did not let go the rabbit. Instead she fought the witch with all her might. As Felicia and the witch were fighting, they didn't notice that the rabbit fell into the water. Felicia did not hesitate to swim into the water and save the drowning rabbit.. Oh my poor, dear rabbit please wake up", she said as she hugged the dying rabbit. She was crying so hard that her tears fell onto the rabbit's body. Suddenly the rabbit turned into a handsome prince. The prince thanked her for saving his life. He kissed Felicia.The prince and Felicia went back to his kingdom and they lived happily ever after.Answer the following questions.1. Who are the characters of the story? A.

                            18. Activity 4. Read to Find the Evidence Read the text below, then answer the questions that follow. For Conversation, Press #1by Michael Alvear I’ve got a cell phone, e-mail, and voice mail. So why am I so lonely? A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and–poof!–I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.  The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Recently I was in a car with three friends. The driver shushed the rest of us because he could not hear the person on the other end of his cell phone. There we were, four friends zooming down the highway, unable to talk to one another because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.  Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.  As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. You can’t even call a person to get the phone number of another person anymore. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated.  Pumping gas at the station? Why say good- morning to the attendant when you can swipe your credit card at the pump and save yourself the bother of human contact?  Making a deposit at the bank? Why talk to a clerk who might live in the neighborhood when you can just insert your card into the ATM?  Pretty soon you won’t have the burden of making eye contact at the grocery store. Some supermarket chains are using a self-scanner so you can check yourself out, avoiding those annoying clerks who look at you and ask how you are doing.  I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, an e-mail account. Giving them up isn’t an option–they’re great for what they’re intended to do. It’s their unintended consequences that make me cringe. More and more, I find myself hiding behind e-mail to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail picked up because I didn’t really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier–or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I’ve put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I’m home.  What good is all this gee-whiz technology if there’s no one in the room to hear you exclaim, “Gee whiz”?A.

Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching
her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the
sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the
doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books
and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye
and when she came near the point at which our ways
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This
happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her,
except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a
summons to all my foolish blood.
