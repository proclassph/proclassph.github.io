                                            Give your reaction on this online review from a disappointed guest. Identify the hotel rooms defects mentioned. "Very disappointing" Reviewed June 30, 2022 We have stayed at the Tavern Lodge in Boracay when attending the volleyball championship sponsored by our company. It has now been sold by Tavern Lodge and is called Shoreside Hotel. It has really gone downhill. We arrived this year at around 10:30pm. Our room had the following defects. First, the light in the shaver socket light above the bathroom mirror did not work; Second, the sealant around the top of the bath was black with mold; Third, the bin in the bathroom was full with sanitary material and other stuff left by previous guest; Fourth, the bed was like a trampoline-sit on one side and the person on the other bounced up in the air. It appears that the new owners are about to refurbish the hotel. It needs it. Until then, stay away and go to the Premier Inn - more expensive but worth it. Stayed June 2022, traveled with friends.??​</a>

He’s done his research and found a model that experts say will more than meet his needs. But new, it costs 35,000php. He also found a refurbished version of the same computer with all of the same features online for 18,000php. The refurbished laptop comes with a warranty and Tom bought a refurbished portable music player from the same company with no problems. Tom’s third option is a brand new laptop that costs 25,000 and has all of the features he needs but not all of the ones he wants.1. What are the wants?2. What are the needs?3.

First, the light in the shaver socket light above the bathroom mirror did not work; Second, the sealant around the top of the bath was black with mold; Third, the bin in the bathroom was full with sanitary material and other stuff left by previous guest; Fourth, the bed was like a trampoline-sit on one side and the person on the other bounced up in the air.

"Very disappointing" Reviewed June 30, 2022 We have stayed at the Tavern Lodge in Boracay when attending the volleyball championship sponsored by our company. It has now been sold by Tavern Lodge and is called Shoreside Hotel. It has really gone downhill. We arrived this year at around 10:30pm. Our room had the following defects. First, the light in the shaver socket light above the bathroom mirror did not work; Second, the sealant around the top of the bath was black with mold; Third, the bin in the bathroom was full with sanitary material and other stuff left by previous guest; Fourth, the bed was like a trampoline-sit on one side and the person on the other bounced up in the air. It appears that the new owners are about to refurbish the hotel. It needs it. Until then, stay away and go to the Premier Inn - more expensive but worth it.

                        <p>As a guest, my reaction to this review would be one of concern and disappointment. It appears that the guest had a number of issues with the room they were provided, including a malfunctioning light in the bathroom, mold around the top of the bathtub, a dirty bathroom trash can, and a bed that was in poor condition. The guest also implies that the hotel is in need of refurbishment, and they would not recommend staying there until these issues are addressed. I understand the importance of maintaining good standards at hotel and the critical role that a clean and comfortable room plays in providing a positive guest experience.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My reaction to this online review from a disappointed guest is one of concern and disappointment. It is clear from the review that the guest had a very negative experience at the Shoreside Hotel, and it is clear that there were a number of defects in the hotel room that contributed to this experience. Specifically, the guest mentions that the light in the shaver socket above the bathroom mirror did not work, the sealant around the top of the bath was black with mold, the bin in the bathroom was full with sanitary material and other stuff left by previous guests, and the bed was like a trampoline. These are all significant issues that would likely be very frustrating for any guest, and it is clear that the hotel needs to address these problems in order to improve the guest experience.</p><p></p><p><strong>I hope this helps!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. If so, it is possible that the transformer/power supply included within this device has failed.</p><p>If it has failed, the best thing to do would be to replace the existing unit.</p><p>(How long has the device been in service?)</p><p>2. Black mold is not only unsightly but also a health risk. As such, finding the right ways to get rid of it is important. The main cause of the black-colored mold is dampness and lingering moisture. Getting rid of it is simple but should be done keenly and with great care as it may be toxic and quite hazardous.</p><p>Remove black mold from bathroom sealant as follows: Create a paste by mixing a cup of white vinegar with a half a cup of baking soda. Using a damp rag, scoop the paste and rub it all over the sealant evenly and well spread. Let the paste sit for close to 10 minutes. Scrub off the paste using the stiff-bristled brush thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>3.The sanitary bin is unlike other waste bins we may have around the home and office. These bins are designed for washroom and bathroom locations and as such, are often used to dispose of feminine hygiene products, razor blades and all manner of personal, hygienic and medicinal waste. For this reason the sanitary bin should have several features.</p><p></p><p>4.
