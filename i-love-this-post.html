                                            What does this poem mean or say?
Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</a>

                            4. What does this poem mean or say?
Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</h2><br />

Yes he didn't think she'll find it.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>After reading the story, I have decided that Tristan Cafe belongs to the <strong>"Flash Fiction" </strong>genre. This is a very short story that has less than 1000 words. Even though it is not long at all, it was still able to evoke emotions and stimulate the imagination of the reader in a few words. The writer <strong>did not go into great detail </strong>but instead focused on the important aspects of it. Despite its length, there was still character and plot development. </p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Do you know what flash fiction is?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Para sa akin, walang mali sa sinabi nya. Although hindi natin alam kung ito ba ay talagang nasa puso nya or pakitang tao lang. Hindi lamang ang presidente ang dapat kumikilos, sya ang nag gguide sa lahat sa kung paano patatakbuhin ang bansa. Bagama't marami parin ang hadlang sa kanyang mga aksyon at ipinatutupad, magbase tayo sa kung ano ang nararanasang komplikasyon at suliranin ng bansa. Isa na yung pandemya, hindi ito maiiwasan pero hindi patay ang paraan. Ang pangulo ay gumagawa ng solusyon at umaaksyon para sa ikaluluwag at ikakaahon ng bansa. He implemented ECQ para atleast mareduce yung number ng cases but still hindi parin pala yun ang makakatulong. Minsan yung misong tao nalang talaga ang problema. Walang pangulo na hindi layunin ang paunlarin ng bansa. Iba iba lang ang proseso nila hindi lang siguro natin nakikita. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Not sure kung tama sagot pero sana nakatulong.</p><br />

We have the lines "Till seashells are broken pieces/From God's own bright teeth" in the last stanza. What does this imply? How does God show His great love? Can you cite evidences or stories that affirm His love? 4. How is love being portrayed in the poem? 5. In the third stanza, why do you think the speaker mentions that all love is to be scaled down? How do you scale down your love? Give examples.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The poetic persona of the poem is not explicitly stated, but it is likely the author herself, Edith Tiempo.The line that is repeated in the first and second stanza is "All that I love". The difference in meaning between the two is that in the first stanza, it seems to be a rhetorical question, while in the second stanza, it is being affirmed that all the things mentioned are indeed things that the speaker loves.The line "Till seashells are broken pieces/From God's own bright teeth" implies that even the smallest and seemingly insignificant things in life are evidence of God's great love. This is seen in the beauty and intricacy of seashells, which are created by God. Examples of stories that affirm God's love could include the story of Jesus sacrificing himself for humanity or the story of the prodigal son in the Bible.Love is being portrayed as something that is cherished and valued, and that can be kept and treasured in small, physical objects.In the third stanza, the speaker mentions scaling down love to emphasize the importance of keeping memories and cherished objects in a compact and tangible form. Scaling down love allows the speaker to keep all that she loves with her at all times, making it easier to remember and cherish the memories associated with those objects. Scaling down love can be done in different ways depending on the individual. For example, keeping sentimental items in a small box or container, carrying a locket or other small keepsake, or even just taking photographs of special moments or objects can help scale down love into something tangible and manageable.<p></p><br />
