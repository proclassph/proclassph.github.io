                                            Direction: Underline each part of the following argumentation.Dear Mom, I think we should get a pet dog. Dogs make great pets because they are loyal. I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loval to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growi u popie they think are a threat. They also ireip boost peopie's moods because they re fnendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a erson's health. According to them dogs reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease nd they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think at I am not responsible enough to have a pei dog. But, i have demonstrated sponsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every ernoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our whole family! Love, Natalie​</a>

Asshe walked around the class, she handed out a study guide. "You will complete thisstudy guide at home tonight. It is due tomorrow. I want to go over it together as aclass so you have enough time to study through the week," Mrs. Beckett explained."Do your best. This study guide looks a lot like the test."Math was difficult for Liam, so he was nervous about the test on ThursdayWith the right answers on his study guide, Liam went to his room every night thatweek and studied. He looked at the problems over and over. It didn't seem to behelping, though. Liam was still very nervous and he felt unprepared. What would theproblems look like on the real test? How would they be different than the studyguide?On Thursday, Liam took his seat in class. He sat next to the smartest girl in thegrade. He glanced over at her paper at the very beginning. Then, it became a habit.aAfter each question he finished, he looked at the girl's paper. He wanted to make surehe got them right. When his answer did not match the girl's, he changed his answer.He decided that she probably had the correct answer since she was so smart. Thepaper came back with a 100. However, Liam's guilt felt heavy in his chest. He didn'tearn that grade, so he couldn't be proud of himself for thatThe characters inremind me of those inthe storyThis story has the theme ofwhich issimilar to the storyWhen the characterThis story reminds me ofwhen I heardon the newsThe issue the character facedis similarto the real worldissue ofU Whenhappened inthe story, I thought of(a currentevent in your community orin the world)This part makes me rememberI thought ofThe problem of this story,which wasreminded me of the problemin the story1.​</a>

Asshe walked around the class, she handed out a study guide. "You will complete thisstudy guide at home tonight. It is due tomorrow. I want to go over it together as aclass so you have enough time to study through the week," Mrs. Beckett explained."Do your best. This study guide looks a lot like the test."Math was difficult for Liam, so he was nervous about the test on ThursdayWith the right answers on his study guide, Liam went to his room every night thatweek and studied. He looked at the problems over and over. It didn't seem to behelping, though. Liam was still very nervous and he felt unprepared. What would theproblems look like on the real test? How would they be different than the studyguide?On Thursday, Liam took his seat in class. He sat next to the smartest girl in thegrade. He glanced over at her paper at the very beginning. Then, it became a habit.aAfter each question he finished, he looked at the girl's paper. He wanted to make surehe got them right. When his answer did not match the girl's, he changed his answer.He decided that she probably had the correct answer since she was so smart. Thepaper came back with a 100. However, Liam's guilt felt heavy in his chest. He didn'tearn that grade, so he couldn't be proud of himself for thatThe characters inremind me of those inthe storyThis story has the theme ofwhich issimilar to the storyWhen the characterThis story reminds me ofwhen I heardon the newsThe issue the character facedis similarto the real worldissue ofU Whenhappened inthe story, I thought of(a currentevent in your community orin the world)This part makes me rememberI thought ofThe problem of this story,which wasreminded me of the problemin the story1.​</h2><br />
