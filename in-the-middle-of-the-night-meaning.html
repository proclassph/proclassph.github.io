Later, when he suggested two mechanisms such as Pohlflucht" which means "night from the poles, explains why continents seemed to drin towards the equator. Another mechanism was that explained that the tidal force was moving the continents. Even after having those mechanisms, his ideas were disapproved. These people rejected Alfred Wegener's ideas because they thought that the tidal force was too weak to move the continents. Alfred Wegener's lack of age and lack of experience in geology was another reason why his hypothesis was rejected. Aner Wegener's death scientists started accept his hypothesis. Geologists like Harry Hammond Hess found proof of accepting the concept of continental drift. He proposed an idea of seafloor spreading. Paleomagnetism was developed in the 1950s which showed "that rocks in different continents appeared to have different directions of magnetization, as if continents had drifted apart from each other." His ideas of seafloor explain that "the ocean floor is constantly being created at underwater ridges in the middle of the oceans, spreading outwards, and being consumed in trenches underneath the continents." At last in the 1960s the continental drift had began to be accepted by the entire earth science community. It took a lot of time for Wegener's hypothesis to become the foundation for a revolution for geologist, but it was accepted later.

                                            Have you ever heard the sound of a hummingbird? They make a buzzing noise when they fly. They make this noise because they beat their wings so fast. They beat their wings up to 80 times a second. All that flapping makes a lot of noise. That's why we call them hummingbirds.Hummingbirds fly in a unique way. They move their wings so fast that they can hover. This means that they can stay in one spot in the middle of the air, like a helicopter. Sometimes they fly or hover upside down. They are the only bird that flies backward.Hummingbirds are small. One type called the bee hummingbird is the smallest bird in the world. Bee hummingbirds weigh less than a penny. They are just a little bit bigger than bees. I guess that's where they get their name. Bee hummingbirds build tiny nests. They use cobwebs and bits of bark to make their homes. Their homes are only an inch around. This is big enough for their eggs though. Their eggs are smaller than peas. People have found these tiny nests on a clothespin.Hummingbirds move fast. It takes lots of energy to move as fast as they do. This means that they need to eat a lot of food. Their favorite food is nectar, a sweet liquid inside of some flowers. They drink more than their own weight in nectar daily. They have to visit hundreds of flowers to get enough nectar to live. They can only store enough energy to survive through the night. They live on the edge.Hummingbirds don't use their long beaks like straws. They have a tongue just like you. They use their tongues for eating. They flick their tongues in and out of their mouths while inside of flowers. They lap up nectar. Flowers givethem the energy that they need.Hummingbirds help flowers too. They get pollen on their heads and bills when they feed. Flowers use pollen to make seeds. Hummingbirds help pollen get from one flower to the next. This helps flowers make more seeds. More seeds mean more flowers. More flowers mean more food for hummingbirds. Isn't it nice how that works out? where is the imformative text? ​</a>

"Such insects are of no use to man, and had i the power , I would cause them to disappear from earth."One day, during a war, this prince was obliged or forced to flee or run away before the enemy. At night, being very much fatigued or tired, he lay down under a tree in the middle of a forest, and soon fell asleep, He as discovered by one of the enemy soldiers, who glided softly up to him,sword in hand, intending to kill him.At this moment, a fly suddenly alighted on the cheek of the prince and stung him so sharply that he awoke. He started up, dre his sword and fought with the soldier, and at last escaped. Then the prince went and hid himself in a cave in the same forest.During the night, a spider spun her thread across the entrance. Two soldiers who were in search of the fugitive prince, came so near that he could hear their conversation. "Look!" said one, "no doubt he is hidden here." "No," replied the other, "he could not have entered without tearing down the spider web."As soon as they had gone, the prince cried out with emotion, raising hands to heaven "O, my God! What a gratitude do i owe thee! Thou didst save my life yesterday by means of a fly, and today thou have preserved me by means of a spider. Truly, there are use and purpose in all the works of Thy creation."​</a>

Throughout the year, different parts of Earth receive the Sun's most direct rays. So, when the North Pole tilts toward the Sun, it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere.</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>For most of the mainland United States the meteorological seasons, agree more with temperatures than the astronomical seasons. ...

You could travel around the Earth on the equator and stay entirely on dry land—ignoring the freezing cold on the night side, and the searing heat on the day side.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>9</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>The four seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter—follow one another regularly.

During spring and autumn, both hemispheres receive about the same amount of sunlight.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>13</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>For the northern hemisphere, summer is the warmest time of year. It's not because the planet is that much closer to the Sun, it's because the top part of the Earth is facing the Sun for a amount of time.

Aretete At first Attred were idea about continental arin were rejected It was not into the ons where scientists began to except his ideas one or the last ographie association called American Association of Petroleum Geologists criticized his ideas pas father in law who was a mos meteorologist also critica his ideas Ceophysicists and American Reolecists such as George Gaylord Simpson and Sir Harold Jemey also rejected his ideas about continental drinThey first rejected him because he was not able to find an adequate mechanism to explain continental drin. Later, when he suggested two mechanisms such as Pohlflucht" which means "night from the poles, explains why continents seemed to drin towards the equator. Another mechanism was that explained that the tidal force was moving the continents. Even after having those mechanisms, his ideas were disapproved. These people rejected Alfred Wegener's ideas because they thought that the tidal force was too weak to move the continents. Alfred Wegener's lack of age and lack of experience in geology was another reason why his hypothesis was rejected. Aner Wegener's death scientists started accept his hypothesis. Geologists like Harry Hammond Hess found proof of accepting the concept of continental drift. He proposed an idea of seafloor spreading. Paleomagnetism was developed in the 1950s which showed "that rocks in different continents appeared to have different directions of magnetization, as if continents had drifted apart from each other." His ideas of seafloor explain that "the ocean floor is constantly being created at underwater ridges in the middle of the oceans, spreading outwards, and being consumed in trenches underneath the continents." At last in the 1960s the continental drift had began to be accepted by the entire earth science community. It took a lot of time for Wegener's hypothesis to become the foundation for a revolution for geologist, but it was accepted later.

                            17. Have you ever heard the sound of a hummingbird? They make a buzzing noise when they fly. They make this noise because they beat their wings so fast. They beat their wings up to 80 times a second. All that flapping makes a lot of noise. That's why we call them hummingbirds.Hummingbirds fly in a unique way. They move their wings so fast that they can hover. This means that they can stay in one spot in the middle of the air, like a helicopter. Sometimes they fly or hover upside down. They are the only bird that flies backward.Hummingbirds are small. One type called the bee hummingbird is the smallest bird in the world. Bee hummingbirds weigh less than a penny. They are just a little bit bigger than bees. I guess that's where they get their name. Bee hummingbirds build tiny nests. They use cobwebs and bits of bark to make their homes. Their homes are only an inch around. This is big enough for their eggs though. Their eggs are smaller than peas. People have found these tiny nests on a clothespin.Hummingbirds move fast. It takes lots of energy to move as fast as they do. This means that they need to eat a lot of food. Their favorite food is nectar, a sweet liquid inside of some flowers. They drink more than their own weight in nectar daily. They have to visit hundreds of flowers to get enough nectar to live. They can only store enough energy to survive through the night. They live on the edge.Hummingbirds don't use their long beaks like straws. They have a tongue just like you. They use their tongues for eating. They flick their tongues in and out of their mouths while inside of flowers. They lap up nectar. Flowers givethem the energy that they need.Hummingbirds help flowers too. They get pollen on their heads and bills when they feed. Flowers use pollen to make seeds. Hummingbirds help pollen get from one flower to the next. This helps flowers make more seeds. More seeds mean more flowers. More flowers mean more food for hummingbirds. Isn't it nice how that works out? where is the imformative text? ​</h2><br />

"Such insects are of no use to man, and had i the power , I would cause them to disappear from earth."One day, during a war, this prince was obliged or forced to flee or run away before the enemy. At night, being very much fatigued or tired, he lay down under a tree in the middle of a forest, and soon fell asleep, He as discovered by one of the enemy soldiers, who glided softly up to him,sword in hand, intending to kill him.At this moment, a fly suddenly alighted on the cheek of the prince and stung him so sharply that he awoke. He started up, dre his sword and fought with the soldier, and at last escaped. Then the prince went and hid himself in a cave in the same forest.During the night, a spider spun her thread across the entrance. Two soldiers who were in search of the fugitive prince, came so near that he could hear their conversation. "Look!" said one, "no doubt he is hidden here."
