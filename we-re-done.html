As a result, he sent out a terrible orderThe whole area was told to put all the old people to deathThis order led to terrible times. Many people simply abandoned theirold people to die. The poor farmer who lived at the bottom of themountain was very upset He dearly loved his mother and the orderof the wicked ruler. So, he tried to find the kindest way to put his mothercaused him great pain. But no one had ever dared to disobey the orderunwhitened rice. This was the main food for people like him and hisAt the end of the day, with his work completed, the farmer took somemother. He cooked it, dried it, and tied it up in a square cloth. He thenswung it in a bundle over his shoulder, along with a pitcher filled withto deathcool water. Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders. Then, with tears in his eyes and pain in his heart, he saidgoodbyeThe old mother gave a last piece of advice to her son. Her voice wastrembling with unselfish love. She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain. The weight seemed light to him now and he was able to makeit through the shadows and the moonlight down to their little hut. Underthe kitchen floor was a hidden basement where food was stored Theson hid his mother in there. He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order. This one was extremely unreasonable Hewanted his people to give him a gift of a rope made of ashesEveryone was in fear. The order had to be obeyed, yet no one in allof Shining knew how to make a rope of ashes. Then, one night, the sontold his mother about the new order from the ruler. Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time. Finally, helifted his head and said, "Shining needs more than strength and youthI forgot the old saying.

What can we do to have a healthy circulatory system? Don't smoke!...Take vitamin E to keep the arteries supple. Eat those fresh vegetables and fruit that supply you with antioxidants- very good for your heart. Eat fish instead of red meat - much better for your heart. 2. First identified in the 1950s, dengue is spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito; the first documented cases were in the Philippines and Thailand. The disease has since struck worldwide, with over 100 countries at risk and 390 million infections yearly. It takes 4-10 days to become obvious, with a high fever and flu-like symptoms. It does not have a cure. The only thing to be done is to maintain the patient's bodily fluids until the disease runs its course. It is crucial that dengue be detected early, as the proper medical attention can lower mortality from 20 percent to just under 1 percent. Left unchecked or identified, dengue kills. 3. Arroyo, who was recently re-elected to a third term as Pampanga representative, received her release papers from the Sandiganbayan after the high tribunal's ruling was released earlier in the day saying the antigraft court erred in its findings that the former President personally benefited from intelligence funds of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). 4. True! -nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them.

Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story. 5. How to keep your hair healthy? Wash your hair two to three times a week. Avoid hot showers. Shampoo your scalp, not your roots. Towel-dry your hair before applying conditioner. Brush your hair twice a day, from the bottom up. Use a low-heat setting for hair-drying and point the nozzle down, not side-on. Try castor oil, hair oil and dry shampoo.nonsense=report or bannedright answer=brainlest and follow​</h2><br />
